            In a significant press conference held at Caritas Sri Lanka, SEDEC,
            on June 30th, 2023, the Catholic Bishops of the Plantation Regions
            united their voices to address the longstanding unresolved
            socioeconomic issues faced by the Indian Origin Plantation Community
            in Sri Lanka. The press conference marked the 200th commemoration of
            the arrival of the Indian Origin Tamil People of the Plantation
            Community in the country in and around 1923-24.
            <br /><br />
            The Catholic Bishops of the Plantation Region including Most. Rev.
            Dr. Harold Anthony Perera, President of the Catholic Bishops’
            Conference in Sri Lanka, Most. Rev. Justin Gnanapragasam, Chairman
            of Caritas Sri Lanka – SEDEC, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith,
            Archbishops of Colombo, Most. Rev. Valence Mendis, Bishop of Kandy
            and Chilaw, Most. Rev. Cletus Chandrasiri, Bishop of Ratnapura, Most
            Rev. Raymond Wickramasinghe, Bishop of Galle, and Most Rev. Jude
            Nishantha Silva, Bishop of Badulla were present at the event.
            <br /><br />
            The primary objectives of the press conference were two-fold.
            Firstly, it aimed at identifying the persisting socio-economic
            issues that have remained unresolved due to the unstable policies
            and inadequate implementation by successive governments and
            plantation management. Secondly, the Catholic Bishops of the
            Plantation Region presented a series of recommendations to include
            the vulnerable Plantation Community in the national social services,
            ultimately striving for their meaningful citizenship in Sri Lanka.
            <br /><br />
            Most. Rev. Harold Anthony, President of the Catholic Bishop’s
            Conference in Sri Lanka, explained the purpose of the press
            conference to educate and raise awareness among the rulers, general
            public, and stakeholders about the enduring agony of the Plantation
            Community over the past two centuries. He emphasized the need to
            address critical areas such as education, health, land and housing,
            livelihood, and culture and heritage, urging the government to take
            appropriate action to uplift the community and grant them their
            deserved dignity as citizens of the country.
            <br /><br />
            Most. Rev. Valence Mendis, Bishop of Kandy and Chilaw, highlighted
            the wage issues faced by the Plantation Community. Despite a
            promised increase of Rs. 1000 two years ago, the raise has not been
            implemented. The community’s limited working days, ranging from two
            to three days per week, result in meager monthly earnings of only
            Rs. 15,000. Moreover, the tea pluckers struggle to meet their daily
            target of 18kg of tealeaves due to the scarcity of leaves.
            <br /><br />
            Bishop Mendis also expressed concerns about the lack of interest and
            involvement from the Sri Lankan state in providing adequate public
            administration to the plantation region. Insufficient representation
            of Grama Niladharis in these estates has resulted in a lack of
            infrastructure facilities such as roads, houses, and toilets. Many
            community members continue to reside in line rooms, despite the
            Indian Government having built 40,000 houses for the Plantation
            Community. The bishops emphasized their continuous advocacy for the
            welfare of this marginalized group.
            <br /><br />
            His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Aarchbishop of Colombo ,
            addressing the historical exploitation endured by the Plantation
            Community called for the appointment of an independent commission to
            investigate the unsolved problems faced by this community over the
            past two centuries. He criticized the plantation companies for
            perpetuating exploitation, emphasizing that providing mere housing
            and infrastructure facilities would not solve the deep-rooted issues
            faced by the community. Cardinal Ranjith stressed the importance of
            treating them as human beings and demanded that the government
            recognize their contributions to the economy and grant them their
            rightful status as dignified citizens.
            <br /><br />
            Forwarded several recommendations to their unresolved socio-
            economic issues for the last 200 years, Cardinal Ranjith emphasized
            the need for a holistic and inclusive approach to addressing the
            socio-economic issues faced by the plantation community in Sri
            Lanka. He called for the government and other stakeholders to take
            proactive measures to address their needs and ensure their full
            integration into society.
            <br /><br />
            Most. Rev. Cletus Chandrasiri, Bishop of Ratnapura, highlighted the
            lack of opportunity for the Plantation Community to live as
            dignified citizens alongside other communities. He emphasized the
            need to protect their unique identity, traditions, and literature,
            which are slowly fading away. Recognizing their services rendered to
            the country over the past two centuries, he urged for their rightful
            recognition and support.
            <br /><br />
            Bishop Raymond Wickramasinghe, Bishop of Galle, drew attention to
            the non-availability of adequate Tamil Stream Schools in the
            Plantation regions, violating the right of Tamil children to study
            in their mother tongue. He recommended the establishment of Tamil
            stream schools in specific regions or the introduction of Tamil
            Stream in Sinhala medium schools, promoting social integration among
            diverse ethnic and religious communities. Bishop Wickramasinghe also
            highlighted the need for preschools, known as ‘Child Development
            Centers,’ to be managed nationally rather than under the Plantation
            Human Development Trust (PHDT) of the Regional Plantation Companies
            (RPC).
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, Bishop Wickramasinghe stressed the lack of vocational
            training centers in the Plantation Region offering courses in Tamil
            medium. He called for the introduction of such courses under the
            Vocational Training Authority (VTA) to address the needs of the
            Plantation community. He further emphasized the urgent need for a
            state university campus affiliated with an existing university in
            the plantation region, specifically focused on preserving the
            plantation industry, environment, traditional art, culture, and
            literature of the Plantation Community.
            <br /><br />
            Most Rev. Jude Nishantha Silva, Bishop of Badulla, pointed out that
            the Plantation Community does not enjoy the benefits of poverty
            eradication programs such as ‘Samurdhi.’ Despite earning a monthly
            income of Rs. 15,000, they are excluded from the program due to its
            income eligibility criteria. Bishop Silva also highlighted the high
            poverty rates and malnutrition among children in the Central and Uva
            provinces, where 78% of the Plantation Community resides. He
            emphasized the importance of reducing existing land use restrictions
            and promoting alternative livelihoods, such as animal husbandry,
            agriculture, home gardening, flower gardening, and small businesses,
            to uplift the community from poverty.
            <br /><br />
            The Catholic Bishops of the Plantation Region have called for
            immediate action to address the unresolved socioeconomic issues
            faced by the Indian Origin Plantation Community in Sri Lanka. Their
            recommendations encompass critical areas such as wages,
            infrastructure, housing, education, language rights, vocational
            training, and poverty eradication. The Bishops urged the government
            and relevant stakeholders to prioritize the integration and
            well-being of this vulnerable community, thereby fostering
            meaningful citizenship and social inclusion in Sri Lanka.
            <br /><br />
            Following the above, there was questions from the media personnel.
            This Press Conference was arranged under the Lighting the Lives of
            Plantation People project funded by Catholic Relief Service (CRS)
            and fully organized by the Environmental Conservation and Plantation
            People Unit of Caritas Sri Lanka – SEDEC.
