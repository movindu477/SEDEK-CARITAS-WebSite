          <p class="caritas-text">
            Thammittagama Village is situated in the Kurunegala District in Sri
            Lanka. A Village level environmental adult group was formed in the
            village under the ‘Stepping Stones to Safeguarding Sri Lanka’s
            Natural Environment project’ (SSEP), implemented by Caritas Sri
            Lanka in early 2023. After several discussions with the villagers, a
            serious issue which affects them badly when it comes to their
            livelihood was identified by villagers and Caritas Janasetha came
            forward to facilitate it. Accordingly, the Thammitigama Tank which
            provides water to facilitate two seasonal paddy cultivations in the
            village are covered with weed and other bushes limiting the storage
            capacity of water to cultivate paddy. As a result, the farmers are
            finding it difficult to cultivate even a single paddy season with
            barely stored water from the tank.
            <br /><br />
            Hence, the villagers with the support of Caritas Kurunagala
            Janasetha organized a cleanup campaign to clear the surface level
            aquatic weed and bushes to enhance the storage capacity of the tank
            on 22nd March 2023 while remembering the World Water Day along with
            the Environmental group members from the village.
            <br /><br />
            Thammittagama is known for paddy cultivation in Kurunagala District.
            Nevertheless, the village is vulnerable to inadequate water for
            farming and irrigation. In addition, the ongoing economic crisis of
            the country is also affecting the daily lives of the people in the
            village. The farmers in Thammitigama Village primarily focus on
            commercial paddy cultivation for both commercial and domestic
            consumption. However, due to the high water requirements of
            commercial paddy cultivation, they limit their cultivation to the
            Maha season only.
            <br /><br />
            As a result, they face unemployment and a lack of work during the
            Yala season. This major issue got aggravated day by day. Therefore,
            in response to these challenges, the environmental group in
            Thammitigama Village had come together to clean and protect their
            only water resource the Thammitigaa Tank available for cultivation
            during the Yala season.
            <br /><br />
            Caritas Kurunagala – Janasetha helped the community in the village
            by taking collective action, which aims to preserve and optimize the
            use of this water resource, ensuring sustainable cultivation and
            livelihoods for the farmers in the village. The entire clean-up
            campaign was held under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Thusitha
            Priyanga, the Director of Caritas Kurunagala. Mr. Wijitha
            Athapaththu, the Divisional Officer of the Department of Agrarian
            Development Nagollagama also joined the special event to support the
            villagers.
            <br /><br />
            Thammitigama Lake covers 48 acres of the area and this is used to
            cultivate 60 – 80 acres of Paddy fields. Cleaning the tank was a
            challenge due to some carnivores’ fishes, snakes, and beetles in the
            lake attacking the villagers who came to clean it. And the epiphytes
            growth over the lake was very dense and it was very hard to cut and
            remove them. These epiphytes grown over the lake cause some skin
            allergies to the farmers.
            <br /><br />
            Hence, farmers had to hire some experienced people with skills and
            know-how from surrounding villages to remove the overgrown bushes in
            the lake. They were able to slice the epiphytes into manageable
            pieces and hauled them to shore where an excavator cleared them from
            the lake. Farmers have planned to use residual from the lake to
            prepare organic fertilizer in the coming weeks. At last, they were
            able to finish the cleaning within 4 days. Although more work
            remained to be done, the cleaned area now stands ready for the
            cultivation in Yala season having stored more water in the tank.
            <br /><br />
            During the 1st year of the project, under the SSEP project, 5
            farmers were to be selected to cultivate traditional paddy
            varieties. Surprisingly Kurunegala Diocese was able to support 28
            farmers in their Diocese to engage in traditional paddy cultivation.
            <br /><br />
            Those farmers now cultivate over 30 acres of lush, native paddy
            fields. In addition to those 28 farmers, the Thammitigama Tank is
            also supporting more farmers who are cultivating in Nagollagama. As
            of now, there are 28 farmer families directly and more than 60
            families indirectly are being benefited by the SSEP project.
            <br /><br />
            The SSEP Village group constructed a billboard to mark this event
            and was eager to clean the tank further till the boundaries of the
            forest reserve which is the nurturing tank. The National Centre team
            visited Thammitigama village and had a discussion with the villagers
            who participated in the clean-up.
            <br /><br />
            The villagers thanked Caritas profusely for the support given and
            promised to sustain the clean-up campaigns regularly.
            <br /><br />
            “Stepping Stones to Safeguarding Sri Lanka’s Natural Environment
            project’ (SSEP) is being implemented in all the 13 Diocesan Centres
            covering the entire island with the funding assistance of Misereor,
            a German development agency comes under the German Catholic Bishop’s
            Conference.
