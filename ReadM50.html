            Rev. Fr. Oswald B Firth, OMI, was a formator, academic,
            administrator, peacebuilder, and activist and had been the former
            director of Caritas Sri Lanka SEDEC (1990-1995) during a period of
            major political and economic upheaval in the country with pressing
            social issues, particularly of development gap across regions and
            breeding inequality at the face of the civil war.
            <br /><br />
            Caritas Sri Lanka – SEDEC embarked on a series of sweeping changes
            and prominent initiatives during his tenure. The first initiative,
            with the partnership with APHD (Asia Partnership for Human
            Development), was to provide legal assistance to the youth accused
            of rebelling against the state and its political leadership during
            the 1988/89 insurrection. The intervention saved the lives of many
            young men and women who were in prisons. The establishment of
            independent Social and Economic Development Centers in each Diocese
            was one of the major accomplishments during his tenure that
            facilitated effective development support by taking into account
            regional development gaps and resource base. The centers established
            were autonomous and could address development needs by seeking donor
            funds separately while the national center played a mediatory role
            by soliciting funds for Diocesan Centers at the national level.
            <br /><br />
            Fr Firth’s emphasis was on the social doctrine of the Catholic
            Church and the integration of its conceptual and pragmatic
            strategies into the daily work and service of Caritas Sri Lanka
            SEDEC. He started a major training program for 700 animators chosen
            from the Diocesan Centers on the social doctrine of the Catholic
            Church with the intention to facilitate effective social change
            using the pathways and insights provided by the doctrine.
            <br /><br />
            Advocacy and lobbying were central to his approach to social change.
            To cite two instances; the first was a massive demonstration at
            Iranawila against setting up of the voice of America, as the country
            would be exposed to danger in the escalation of conflict between
            powerful states, and the second instance was the opposing the
            construction of a five-star hotel in Kadalama which would have
            threaten environment and biodiversity. It was remarkable how closely
            he worked with numerous civil society organizations, activists, and
            grassroots.
            <br /><br />
            Fr Firth was of the view that development cannot be isolated from
            environmental sustainability, peace, and justice, the precursor for
            development initiatives. His observation also was that the programs
            for the support of marginalized communities with foreign aid were
            not necessarily addressing the root causes of the wider social
            issues of the communities. The basis of his approach to social
            development was the evaluation of the current situations of
            marginalized communities by which strategies could be designed and
            adopted.
            <br /><br />
            Lastly, he was a peace builder who interlinked SEDEC’s programs with
            different religious communities with the understanding that
            development is inclusive irrespective of differences of any form.
            <br /><br />
            It is a special call to engage in human struggle against the
            liberation of the oppressed from social unjust and inequality that
            impede human progress and well-being and many priests have been
            advocating for social reforms. Rev. Fr. Oswald B Firth, OMI, was one
            of the social activists of par excellence.
            <br /><br />
            Dear Rev. Father, we embrace your teachings and are inspired by your
            life to be a fighter till the end for the liberation of poor and
            destitute. We shall continue the journey to the liberation of
            victims and against the internalization of oppression in the wider
            community. May your gentle soul rest in Peace.
            <br /><br />
