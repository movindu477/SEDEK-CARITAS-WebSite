            <b>Introduction</b>
            <br /><br />
            World Environmental day is celebrated globally on 5th June from 1973. The day provides a platform for environmental activists to voice their concerns and highlight the negative impacts of global environmental issues to the global community. In that line, the theme for World Environmental Day 2023 focuses on ‘Solution for Plastic Pollution’ under the campaign #Beattheplastic.
            <br /><br />
            ‘Stepping Stone to Safeguarding Sri Lanka’s Natural Environment Project’ (SSEP) was implemented by Caritas Sri Lanka in 2022. It is believed that community involvement plays a major role in protecting and restoring the environment. Therefore, SSEP chooses to assist the selected communities who face the effects of environmental degradation and address the environmental issues to bring sustainable solutions. Caritas Sri Lanka is currently undertaking several environmental and development initiatives through it’s Diocesan network under SSEP. Commemorating World Environmental Day is one of the key activities that was carried out by the DCs with the participation of the Environmental group members in 2022 & 2023.
            <br /><br />
            Caritas Diocesan Network conducted community projects such as cleanup campaigns, awareness-creating parades, awareness-creating sessions including street dramas and speeches, tree planting campaigns and art competitions for kids in line with World Environmental Day. This project is carried out with the funding assistance of Misereor.
