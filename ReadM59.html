          An awareness session for clergy of the Diocese of Kandy was
          conducted on 4th of April 2023 at the Fatima Retreat House Lewella,
          Kandy with the aim of highlighting the social issues of the
          Plantation community and the mission of the church leaders in
          addressing the causes of structural discrimination that the
          plantation community (Malaiyaga Tamils) have faced over the last 200
          years in Sri Lanka.
          <br /><br />
          His Lordship Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis – the Bishop of Kandy
          Diocese, Rev. Fr. Luke Nelson – National Director, Caritas Sri
          Lanka, SEDEC, Rev. Fr. Desmond Perera – Director of SETIK, Rev. Fr.
          Michael Rajendram – National Animator, for the LLPP program, Mr.
          Sajith Silva – Unit Head of the Ecological Conservation and
          Plantation Peoples Unit, Ms. Niranjani Roland and Ms. Vaishnave
          Lavaneswaran- CSL staff and Mr. Muthulingam Periyasamy – Executive
          Director for the Institute of Social Development and over 60 priests
          including the priests from the Plantation community in the Diocese
          of Kandy participated at the event.
          <br /><br />
          Rev. Fr. Desmond Perera moderated the program and explained the
          objectives of the program.
          <br /><br />
          Rev. Fr. Luke Nelson, National Director, Caritas Sri Lanka, SEDEC
          explained on the services and the current interventions of Caritas
          Sri Lanka, SEDEC in addressing the social issues of the marginalized
          communities in Sri Lanka.
          <br /><br />
          “We have understood the plight of the plantation community who live
          in 6 Dioceses in Sri Lanka such as Kandy, Badulla, Ratnapura, Galle,
          Colombo and Kurunegala and have launched the program called LLPP to
          do more advocacy and lobbying to light the lives of the plantation
          people. The program aims to address the 200 years of the hardship of
          the plantation people and I know that Rev. Fr. Desmond play an
          important role to address the issues of the plantation people in the
          Kandy Diocese. I am grateful to the Catholic Relief Service (CRS)
          for the support of this meaningful program. We are seeking your
          valuable comments, suggestion and opinion to implement our program
          more effectively,” said Rev. Fr. Nelson.
          <br /><br />
          Rev. Fr. Rajendram said that “Many people have a doubt as to who are
          these Malayaga Tamils. This identity comes from the geographical
          areas that they live and we like to proceed with that identity. They
          face many social issues as they have not been included in the
          national stream of education, health, livelihood, land and housing.
          Therefore, they are unable to enjoy the rights like other citizens
          of the country. He further stated that even though the plantation
          people have contributed immensely for the national economy still
          their contribution is not fully recognized and unfortunately they
          are being discriminated of their basic human rights.
          <br /><br />
          Mr. Muthulingam Periyasamy, Executive Director of Institute of
          Sustainable Development (ISD) explained on how the church could move
          forward in addressing the rights of this oppressed community.
          <br /><br />
          “One of the founders of Liberation theology, had once said that the
          duty of a Christian is to aid the poor and oppressed through the
          involvement in the civic and political affairs. In the past history
          many clergies in the Latin American countries worked for the
          oppressed people” said Mr. Periyasamy.
          <br /><br />
          He further explained how he began his organization named ISD to work
          for his own community.
          <br /><br />
          “I can remember once I have spoken to Fathers like Fr. Nandana
          Manathunga, Fr. Firth on my interest to advocate for my own
          plantation community and the policy makers on the issues faced by my
          community. With the recommendation of Fr. Firth, I wrote a proposal
          and got funds, that is how I started my organization and served my
          society for the last 32 years. I have never given tangible things to
          them, just advocacy and lobbying on the plight of the plantation
          community to the policy makers to bring the changes in their living
          conditions”.
          <br /><br />
          “During that period many of the Catholic and Christian Fathers were
          involved in the development programs. I spoke with Fr. Paul Casperz
          on advocacy and lobbying and he said we can’t come forward but we
          will support your advocacy and lobbying work and he also said a day
          should come where the church should focus on the breach of human
          rights of the plantation community otherwise we can’t bring
          sustainable changes,” said Mr. Periyasawmy.
          <br /><br />
          Mr. Periyaswamy in his speech highlighted further on followings;
          <br /><br />
          “The church should involve in the protection of the rights and
          involve in advocacy. At present 169,000 line rooms and 30,000 small
          sheds are existing in the plantation sector where these oppressed
          people lived for 200 years. Each generation to generation, they live
          in a 10 x 12-line house. In 169,000 line rooms, 250,000 families are
          living at present until today, as they cannot extend the house.
          <br /><br />
          There are many universities in the Country. In the last two years,
          1500 plantation students entered the Universities in the Arts
          Faculty. There are so many doctors and teaching hospitals in the
          country but in the plantation sector, we still have Estate Medical
          Practioners. In 1972, the Land reform act was introduced with
          several changes that occurred in the country but still the
          plantation community is a landless community. Several times, we
          lobby with the government but still we could not get a sustainable
          solution for that. From 1998, we are lobbying for the inclusion of
          the plantation community to the main stream.
          <br /><br />
          With the participation of the civil society members, we have already
          prepared and presented an action plan to the policy makers on these
          rights based issues. Therefore, as a church based organization you
          all should continuously advocate and lobby with policy makers to
          bring sustainable development to this marginalized and oppressed
          community,” he further said.
          <br /><br />
          Later, the forum was opened for questions and answers.
          <br /><br />
          Rev. Fr. Satkunaraja, from the Loolkandura Estate in the Kandy
          district, where the first tree was planted by James Taylor in 1986,
          explained the present condition of the plantation people in his
          parish.
          <br /><br />
          “The estate was closed down and it’s now like a jungle. The people
          are unemployed, line houses remain as it is with poor sanitation
          facilities. However, the people were not allowed to build a toilet,
          no proper water supply. Children in the area of Lookandura had their
          sport meet in the roads; still they live like slaves. This is the
          plight of many tea plantation communities” said Fr. Satkunaraja.
          <br /><br />
          Mr. Muthulingam replied for these issues and said once a circular
          was issued with regards to the plantation schools and emphasized
          that every school should have 2 acres of land. The Estate should
          give permission but the only requirement was that the principal has
          to write and request the estate management on this regard.
          <br /><br />
          Fr. N. Abraham shared his opinion that due recognition should be
          given to the plantation people who have served for this society. He
          further said that“ Being a priest for 36 years, I have not done much
          to my own community. As a community we should fight for our own
          issues. It is not only Kandy Diocese but the Bishops Conference
          should raise these issues and put pressure together then only we can
          get tangible answers otherwise it will be an individual fight”
