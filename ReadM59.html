            An awareness session for clergy of the Diocese of Kandy was
            conducted on 4th of April 2023 at the Fatima Retreat House Lewella,
            Kandy with the aim of highlighting the social issues of the
            Plantation community and the mission of the church leaders in
            addressing the causes of structural discrimination that the
            plantation community (Malaiyaga Tamils) have faced over the last 200
            years in Sri Lanka.
            <br /><br />
            His Lordship Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis – the Bishop of Kandy
            Diocese, Rev. Fr. Luke Nelson – National Director, Caritas Sri
            Lanka, SEDEC, Rev. Fr. Desmond Perera – Director of SETIK, Rev. Fr.
            Michael Rajendram – National Animator, for the LLPP program, Mr.
            Sajith Silva – Unit Head of the Ecological Conservation and
            Plantation Peoples Unit, Ms. Niranjani Roland and Ms. Vaishnave
            Lavaneswaran- CSL staff and Mr. Muthulingam Periyasamy – Executive
            Director for the Institute of Social Development and over 60 priests
            including the priests from the Plantation community in the Diocese
            of Kandy participated at the event.
            <br /><br />
            Rev. Fr. Desmond Perera moderated the program and explained the
            objectives of the program.
            <br /><br />
            Rev. Fr. Luke Nelson, National Director, Caritas Sri Lanka, SEDEC
            explained on the services and the current interventions of Caritas
            Sri Lanka, SEDEC in addressing the social issues of the marginalized
            communities in Sri Lanka.
            <br /><br />
            “We have understood the plight of the plantation community who live
            in 6 Dioceses in Sri Lanka such as Kandy, Badulla, Ratnapura, Galle,
            Colombo and Kurunegala and have launched the program called LLPP to
            do more advocacy and lobbying to light the lives of the plantation
            people. The program aims to address the 200 years of the hardship of
            the plantation people and I know that Rev. Fr. Desmond play an
            important role to address the issues of the plantation people in the
            Kandy Diocese. I am grateful to the Catholic Relief Service (CRS)
            for the support of this meaningful program. We are seeking your
            valuable comments, suggestion and opinion to implement our program
            more effectively,” said Rev. Fr. Nelson.
            <br /><br />
            Rev. Fr. Rajendram said that “Many people have a doubt as to who are
            these Malayaga Tamils. This identity comes from the geographical
            areas that they live and we like to proceed with that identity. They
            face many social issues as they have not been included in the
            national stream of education, health, livelihood, land and housing.
            Therefore, they are unable to enjoy the rights like other citizens
            of the country. He further stated that even though the plantation
            people have contributed immensely for the national economy still
            their contribution is not fully recognized and unfortunately they
            are being discriminated of their basic human rights.
            <br /><br />
            Mr. Muthulingam Periyasamy, Executive Director of Institute of
            Sustainable Development (ISD) explained on how the church could move
            forward in addressing the rights of this oppressed community.
            <br /><br />
            “One of the founders of Liberation theology, had once said that the
            duty of a Christian is to aid the poor and oppressed through the
            involvement in the civic and political affairs. In the past history
            many clergies in the Latin American countries worked for the
            oppressed people” said Mr. Periyasamy.
            <br /><br />
            He further explained how he began his organization named ISD to work
            for his own community.
            <br /><br />
            “I can remember once I have spoken to Fathers like Fr. Nandana
            Manathunga, Fr. Firth on my interest to advocate for my own
            plantation community and the policy makers on the issues faced by my
            community. With the recommendation of Fr. Firth, I wrote a proposal
            and got funds, that is how I started my organization and served my
            society for the last 32 years. I have never given tangible things to
            them, just advocacy and lobbying on the plight of the plantation
            community to the policy makers to bring the changes in their living
            conditions”.
            <br /><br />
            “During that period many of the Catholic and Christian Fathers were
            involved in the development programs. I spoke with Fr. Paul Casperz
            on advocacy and lobbying and he said we can’t come forward but we
            will support your advocacy and lobbying work and he also said a day
            should come where the church should focus on the breach of human
            rights of the plantation community otherwise we can’t bring
            sustainable changes,” said Mr. Periyasawmy.
            <br /><br />
            Mr. Periyaswamy in his speech highlighted further on followings;
            <br /><br />
            “The church should involve in the protection of the rights and
            involve in advocacy. At present 169,000 line rooms and 30,000 small
            sheds are existing in the plantation sector where these oppressed
            people lived for 200 years. Each generation to generation, they live
            in a 10 x 12-line house. In 169,000 line rooms, 250,000 families are
            living at present until today, as they cannot extend the house.
            <br /><br />
            There are many universities in the Country. In the last two years,
            1500 plantation students entered the Universities in the Arts
            Faculty. There are so many doctors and teaching hospitals in the
            country but in the plantation sector, we still have Estate Medical
            Practioners. In 1972, the Land reform act was introduced with
            several changes that occurred in the country but still the
            plantation community is a landless community. Several times, we
            lobby with the government but still we could not get a sustainable
            solution for that. From 1998, we are lobbying for the inclusion of
            the plantation community to the main stream.
            <br /><br />
            With the participation of the civil society members, we have already
            prepared and presented an action plan to the policy makers on these
            rights based issues. Therefore, as a church based organization you
            all should continuously advocate and lobby with policy makers to
            bring sustainable development to this marginalized and oppressed
            community,” he further said.
            <br /><br />
            Later, the forum was opened for questions and answers.
            <br /><br />
            Rev. Fr. Satkunaraja, from the Loolkandura Estate in the Kandy
            district, where the first tree was planted by James Taylor in 1986,
            explained the present condition of the plantation people in his
            parish.
            <br /><br />
            “The estate was closed down and it’s now like a jungle. The people
            are unemployed, line houses remain as it is with poor sanitation
            facilities. However, the people were not allowed to build a toilet,
            no proper water supply. Children in the area of Lookandura had their
            sport meet in the roads; still they live like slaves. This is the
            plight of many tea plantation communities” said Fr. Satkunaraja.
            <br /><br />
            Mr. Muthulingam replied for these issues and said once a circular
            was issued with regards to the plantation schools and emphasized
            that every school should have 2 acres of land. The Estate should
            give permission but the only requirement was that the principal has
            to write and request the estate management on this regard.
            <br /><br />
            Fr. N. Abraham shared his opinion that due recognition should be
            given to the plantation people who have served for this society. He
            further said that“ Being a priest for 36 years, I have not done much
            to my own community. As a community we should fight for our own
            issues. It is not only Kandy Diocese but the Bishops Conference
            should raise these issues and put pressure together then only we can
            get tangible answers otherwise it will be an individual fight”
