            Caritas Sri Lanka – SEDEC in collaboration with its network, is
            implementing a Food Security program titled
            <b
              ><i
                >“Improving Rural Livelihoods, Enhancing Food Security, and
                Building Climate Resilience in Sri Lanka.”</i
              ></b
            >This initiative is spearheaded by Rev. Fr. Luke Nelson Perera,
            National Director of Caritas Sri Lanka – SEDEC, with support from
            Caritas Norway. The program aims to improve food security for 26,200
            subsistence farming households, including marginalized urban and
            rural communities in select villages across Sri Lanka. It
            specifically targets vulnerable groups such as war widows, women,
            youth, persons with disabilities, and 32,500 schoolchildren,
            equipping them with knowledge of sustainable agricultural practices
            and home gardening. Additionally, the program focuses on 13,000
            mothers of preschool children, working to safeguard their children
            from malnutrition by 2028. Already, the program has fostered
            significant positive change in rural communities across Sri Lanka.
            Below, we share one such inspiring story of transformation.
            <br /><br />
            My name is R.A. Kumarika Ranaweera, and I am 48 years old. I live in
            a village called Sumudugama, located in the Thalawa Divisional
            Secretariat Division of Anuradhapura. I am a mother of two children,
            and together with my husband, we lead a very happy family life.
            <br /><br />
            In 2023, Caritas Anuradhapura – Sethsaviya introduced the Food
            Security Program to our village. This initiative, supported by
            Caritas Norway, is being implemented by Caritas Sri Lanka’s network
            across all 25 administrative districts in Sri Lanka. Through this
            program, Caritas Anuradhapura provided us with valuable training in
            sustainable home gardening practices, with a focus on composting
            without chemical additives. The goal was to ensure a toxin-free and
            sustainable food supply for our households. We learned how to
            prepare compost using the “Jeewakotuwa” method and the Pit method,
            as well as how to create natural pest repellents (such as Magoza
            leaf extraction, Gliricidia leaf extraction, and garlic solution)
            and liquid fertilizers. Additionally, we were taught how to select
            and prepare a Home garden that is resilient to Sri Lanka’s changing
            climate.
            <br /><br />
            As part of the program, we received traditional seeds, poly bags,
            and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems from Caritas Anuradhapura.
            Agronomists, agricultural instructors, and Caritas Food Security
            staff provided expert guidance throughout the process. Exposure
            visits to an agronomist’s home garden sparked great interest among
            us, where we learned practical Home gardening techniques, such as
            proper pruning. We were also introduced to the concept of wormy
            compost and received support with various techniques to improve our
            gardening.
            <br /><br />
            My entire family has been actively involved in home gardening, which
            has not only brought us closer together but also increased our
            overall happiness. What was once unproductive land has now become
            highly productive, providing a steady source of income for my
            family. In our garden, we grow 20 varieties of fruits, 25 types of
            vegetables, 15 kinds of leafy greens, 15 herbs, 15 spices, and 6
            different grains. Additionally, I have completed training in
            composting, worm composting and worm tea production, pest-repellent
            creation, animal husbandry, and nursery management. These practices
            have become integral to the success of my home garden.
            <br /><br />
            My garden has become a model farm for our village, and many people
            come to visit and learn from it. Officials from the Department of
            Agriculture and staff from National Caritas have also visited. Over
            time, we have gained the confidence to voice our concerns on social
            issues and advocate for our civil rights. As a result, we prepared
            three proposals to present to religious leaders, government
            officials, and the Provincial Director of the Department of
            Agriculture. These proposals addressed local agricultural
            challenges, the human-elephant conflict, and the economic
            difficulties faced by our community.
            <br /><br />
            As a mother, I am truly happy because I can now feed my children and
            husband nutritious, poison-free food that we grow together as a
            family. I no longer need to buy these food items, and the money I
            used to spend on food is now available for other family needs, such
            as our children’s education and healthcare. I have saved money in
            the bank and the community-based organization (CBO), and I am also
            able to share my produce with others in the village.
            <br /><br />
            We are deeply grateful to Caritas Sri Lanka and Caritas Norway for
            this transformative project in our village.
