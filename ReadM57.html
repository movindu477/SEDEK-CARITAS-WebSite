          <p class="caritas-text">
            Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL) organized an Environmental Management and
            Leadership Program for the youth in the Diocese of Chilaw under the
            “Stepping Stone to Safeguarding Sri Lanka’s Natural Environment
            project” (SSEP). SSEP is a project implemented by Caritas Sri Lanka
            with the goal of creating an environmentally conscious community
            through advocating and lobbying against all the severe environmental
            issues that they face in their daily life. The physical environment
            around us is the source of our life. Hence the project strives to
            capacitate the local community to adapt and mitigate the adverse
            consequences of climate change. A wide range of beneficiaries from
            adults, youths and children are a part of this project.
            <br /><br />
            As a part of this journey to reach the ultimate goal of the SSEP,
            several capacity-building programs for youths are taking place in
            all the Districts in Sri Lanka with the funding support of Misereor.
            With that note, this leadership program was organized by CSL to
            capacitate the selected group of youths from Chilaw DC on leadership
            as well as environmental management. It was a two-day workshop held
            on the 29th and 30th of March at Caritas Chilaw – SEDEC. Mr. Sajeewa
            Chamikara from MONLAR (Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform)
            and Mr. Karunadasa Munagama, founder of ‘Mihithala Mithuro’
            Environment Development Foundation took part in this workshop as
            resource persons.
            <br /><br />
            Day 1 of the program focused mainly on building foundational
            knowledge and skills related to leadership and ecological systems.
            Day one was started with a common prayer by the Diocesan Director of
            Chilaw, Rev Fr. Dilan Marius Fernando. Mr. Sajith Silva Head of the
            Unit- ECPP (Ecological Conservation and Plantation People) at
            Caritas Sri Lanka -SEDEC continued the program with an orientation
            to the SSEP program. He illustrated the major project objectives and
            responsibilities of youth in the care of our common home. Later, the
            resource team was introduced to the participants.
            <br /><br />
            The participants were divided into 5 groups as the first step to
            initiating the entire program. Each group was asked to assign a
            leader and a writer. Mr. Munagama carried out a series of group
            activities based on leadership skills, team building, team spirit,
            and the importance of teamwork to the youth. Participants
            enthusiastically participated in all the group activities. Later Mr.
            Chamikara conducted a lecture and an interactive session on the
            Ecological System Theory. During the session, he emphasized that we
            human beings are also a part of the environment but we are not
            allowed to control it. Through his explanation, he opened the eyes
            of participants to look at the environment from a different
            perspective. The youth were really engaged and asked multiple
            questions and shared their thoughts with Mr. Chamikara. In the
            evening, participants engaged in a variety of practical activities
            aimed at reinforcing their learning.
            <br /><br />
            It is believed that a happy team builds happy products, so before
            ending the day one session the participants were asked to
            participate in the entertaining program which was inclusive of their
            own performances. Most of the participants presented their talents
            in front of the others and they mentioned that what they learnt
            about leadership in the morning prompted them to come forward in
            front of a crowd without hesitation.
            <br /><br />
            Day 2 of the program was focused on developing awareness about the
            diversity of plants & animals in Sri Lanka’s natural environment and
            exploring ways to create positive change in youths by actively
            safeguarding their natural environment. The morning was begun with
            an inspiring talk by Rev. Fr. Dilan Marius Fernando. He shared his
            thoughts on environmental conservation and the role of the youth in
            safeguarding the resources for future generations. He also provided
            tips on how to advocate against environmental injustice.
            <br /><br />
            Later, Mr. Chamikara asked all the youth participants for a recap of
            the previous day’s key learnings. Participants developed their own
            action plans for presenting the learnings of day 01. All the groups
            showed their creativity with their presentations. Some presented
            learnings through flow charts while others through drama and
            dialogue. One special arrangement of the presentations was that one
            particular group did not use paper and pens for their presentation.
            They explained in their presentation that those materials might be
            thrown away as trash, and they did not want to promote the behavior
            of this type, especially during a program like this. Mr. Chamikara
            and Mr. Munagama appreciated the teamwork and presentations done by
            all the groups.
            <br /><br />
            After the recap, Mr. Chamikara continued a lecture on endemic and
            endangered animals and explained how human activities have
            threatened the survival of those animals in particular. He further
            mentioned to all the youth to take the lead on environmental issues
            in their areas and always act as responsible citizens to conserve
            our common home.
            <br /><br />
            The workshop gave a chance to create a network among the
            participants. The organizing team believed that it would lead to the
            formation of new relationships and collaborations while opening ways
            for further impactful actions toward environmental sustainability.
            <br /><br />
            Overall, the Environmental Management and Leadership Program for
            Youth was a tremendous success. The youth shared their feedback
            about the program and intentions as to how they would use the gained
            knowledge for environmentally friendly interventions in their
            communities.
            <br /><br />
            Through the feedback, participants mentioned that they never had an
            opportunity and chance before to learn about the life, leadership
            and environmental protection in this manner. They promised that they
            would share this knowledge with the villagers and will work together
            to find sustainable solutions for the environmental issues they all
            face.
            <br /><br />
            They also expressed their gratitude towards resource persons,
            organizers and funding partners for imparting new knowledge on
            environmental protection.
