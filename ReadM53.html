            <b>Introduction</b>
            <br /><br />
            Water is one of the most important basic natural elements on which
            the planet Earth is comprised of, as it constitutes 71% of the land
            area. In addition, water is recognized as the giver and the source
            of life, bestowing a prime position in the cycle of life due to its
            high importance. Hence, the right to water and sanitation was
            recognized as a human right by the UN general assembly in 2010. Not
            only water is a core human right, but it is also indispensable for
            our economies, ensuring food and energy security, promoting peace
            and health, protecting nature, and combatting climate change.
            Stepping Stone to Safeguarding Sri Lanka’s Natural Environment
            Project (SSEP) is implemented by Caritas Sri Lanka in 2022 with the
            ultimate goal of restoring and rebuilding the degraded environment
            of Sri Lanka with community involvement. Restoring the existing
            drinking water resources is one of the key areas that SSEP is
            focusing on.
            <br /><br />
            Therefore, World Water Day was celebrated by Caritas network in many
            parts of Sri Lanka in March 2023 under theme of ‘Water for a
            sustainable world’. Caritas Diocesan Centers conducted several
            awareness-creation activities such as cleanup campaigns, walks and
            awareness sessions in March 2023 under SSEP, while highlighting the
            importance of water and sanitation.

            <br /><br />
            World Water Day is celebrated annually on the 22nd of March to
            celebrate water and raise awareness on access to safe and clean
            water. 40% of the world’s population is affected by water scarcity
            due to over demand, mismanagement and the impact of the triple
            crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Clean
            drinking water is fundamental but it is also vital for sanitation
            and hygiene. Therefore, raising awareness of the importance of water
            consumption and conserving existing water resources is important to
            ensure the good health of our future generations. These beach
            cleanup programs will help to reduce ocean pollution and inspire
            participants to make a sustainable difference in their daily
            livelihood and attitudes in genral.
            <br /><br />
            2.2 billion people worldwide need regular access to clean water. So,
            these cleanup programs are not only for the community around its
            area but crucial for the whole world to reduce water pollution. By
            working together, we can protect our water resources and ensure they
            remain healthy and thriving. The once-littered and polluted oceans
            can be transformed into a beautiful oasis of clean sand and
            crystal-clear waters for generations if everyone joins hands on this
            world water day.
