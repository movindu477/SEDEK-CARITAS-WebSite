          <p class="caritas-text">
            The Plantation Community in Sri Lanka mainly consists of the Indian
            Origin Tamils who are presently known as the ‘Malayaga Tamils”
            meaning Upcountry Tamils.
            <br /><br />
            As per the historical evidence, the arrival of the 1st batch of
            Indian Origin Tamil Speaking workers happened from 1823 to 1824,
            thus making 2023/2024 as the 200th years of their existence and
            service in Sri Lanka with much hardships & challenges. They were
            brought in from South India as bonded labourers by the colonial
            masters to work on the coffee plantations.
            <br /><br />
            Since then, they have remained a marginalized community in the Sri
            Lankan society and have faced challenges and hardships in addition
            to the inhuman work conditions with which they have to work until
            today. They have now become the most vulnerable ethnic community in
            Sri Lanka according to many development indicators.
            <br /><br />
            They have been discriminated in sharing the opportunities as equal
            citizens.
            <br /><br />
            Since January 2022, Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL) has launched a unique
            Program of NETWORKING with all Civil Society Organizations(CSOs) who
            render service to / among the Plantation Community in the Dioceses /
            regions of Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Wayamba & Western provinces
            (11 Civil Districts in Sri Lanka) in order to voice together for the
            grievances faced by this Community. Many sociologists and social /
            civil workers identify this as a structural discrimination, which
            has cornered them for centuries from the ordinary way of living
            conditions, which enjoyed by the other Sri Lankans in the country.
            <br /><br />
            This project intervention is made possible with the generous support
            by the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) of the United States of
            America with an initial monitory help to start with the collective
            efforts of Net working with CSOs.
            <br /><br />
            The Catholic National Commission for Justice, Peace & Human
            Development has been endorsed to carry forward the initiative. Thus,
            Caritas Sri Lanka jointly with its Diocesan counterparts are
            implementing the programme. The Diocesan Directors with their able
            staff members of the Diocesan centers (DCs) have been very
            enthusiastic and got themselves involved in the above program since
            it was introduced in January 2022.
            <br /><br />
            The project is designed to call upon all the Actors & Stakeholders
            in the Government, Non-Governmental Organizations and the Civil
            Society Organizations to join hands towards this worthy cause and
            TOGETHER BECOMING ACTIVE PARTNERS in the life struggle of this
            Community.
