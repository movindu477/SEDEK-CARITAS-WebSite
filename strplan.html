        <b><i>Rooted in the Gospel, Committed to the Poor, Called to
            Transform</i></b>
        <br /><br />
        At the heart of the Church's mission is the call to love, not as
        sentiment, but as a powerful, transformative force that upholds the
        dignity of every human being, especially the poor, marginalized, and
        vulnerable. This love, rooted in faith and action, drives the Church's
        commitment to justice and compassion.As Pop Benedict XVI affirms in
        <i>Deus Caritas Est,</i> "Love-Caritas-will always prove necessary,
        even in the most just society"(DCE,§28). It is this enduring call that
        inspires and shapes the mission and work of Caritas Sri Lanka.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Purpose and Scope of the Strategic Plan (2026-2030)</b>
        <br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), the social arm of the Catholic Bishops'
        Conference of Sri Lanka, reaffirms its mission through this Strategic
        Plan (2026-2030), rooted in Catholic Social Teaching and responsive to
        the country's socio-economic, political, and environmental realities.
        Guided by Gospel values, the plan defines CSL's strategic direction as
        a faith-based actor committed to justice, compassion, and human
        dignity.
        <br /><br />
        The plan outlines key thematic priorities and goals across sectors
        including education, livehoods, healtth, environment, disaster risk
        reduction, peacebuilding, and migration. It ensures alignment with the
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), national development strategies,
        and the ongoing economic restructuring agenda. Covering both dioceasan
        and national levels, the plan provides a unifieed framework for
        effective implemntation, monitoring, and learning-enabling CSL to
        adopt to emerging challenges while continuing to serve the most
        vulnereable communities with relevance and impact.
        <br /><br />
        This strategic plan offers a renwed vision for CSL, inspired by the
        theological insights of
        <i>Deus Caritas Est, Caritas in Veritate, Rerum Novarum, Laudato Si',
          Fratelli Tutti,</i>
        and the <i>spirit of Synodality.</i> These documents together form the
        backbone of the Church's social doctrine provide a profound framework
        to address today's interrelated crisis: poverty, inequality,
        environemnt degradation, displacement, and cultural fragmentation.
        <br /><br />
        <b>1. Theological and Social Foundations: Love, Truth, and Justice</b>
        <br /><br />
        The Church's social teaching, being with <i>Rerum Novarum</i>(1891),
        establishes that the condition of the working classes and the rights
        of the poor are central to the Gospel mandate.Pope Leo XIII writes,
        "Every program of actionshould be concerned above all with the
        well-being of the workers" (RN,§31).CSL's work with plantation
        communities, war-affected families, and economically marginalized
        groups echoes this call, focusing on advocacy and rights promotion,
        especially in regions long neglected by mainstream development.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Caritas in Veritate</i>(2009) by Pope Benedict XVI affirms that
        charity must be grounded in truth and justice: "Charity is at the
        heart of the Church's social doctrine" (CiV,§2). It is not enough to
        respond to symptoms of poverty; struuctural injustice must be
        transformed. CSL's focus on organizational capacity building and
        sustainable developemnt represents a deliberate effort to move from
        short-term relief to long-term empowerment, building systems and
        communities capable of advocating for their own rights and well-being.
        <br /><br />
        From the theological foundation of love (agape), CSL’s work is not
        merely functional — it is spiritual. In the Sri Lankan context, where
        communities carry deep wounds from civil conflict, ethnic division,
        and economic hardship, love becomes a healing force. As Fratelli Tutti
        (2020) powerfully states: “Love shatters the chains that keep us
        isolated and separate; in their place, it builds bridges” (FT, §62).
        CSL’s peace and reconciliation programs seek precisely to build such
        bridges — between communities, ethnic groups, and religious traditions
        — offering healing and promoting a culture of encounter.
        <br /><br />
        <b>2. A Synodal Approach: Journeying Together in Mission</b>
        <br /><br />
        In the current ecclesial context, the Synod on Synodality invites the
        Church to walk together listening, discerning, and acting as one body.
        CSL’s strategic planning process embraces this spirit. The plan was
        shaped through dialogue with diocesan Caritas partners, local
        communities, Church leaders, and civil society actors, ensuring that
        it reflects both the voice of the poor and the guidance of the Spirit
        <br /><br />
        Synodality is not a method; it is a way of being Church. As Pope
        Francis explains, “A synodal Church is a Church of listening” (Synod
        Preparatory Document, 2021). CSL remains committed to localization
        empowering diocesan Caritas units and community-based organizations to
        lead in planning, implementation, and monitoring. This decentralized
        approach ensures contextual relevance and ownership while remaining
        united in mission.
        <br /><br />
        <b>3. Strategic Pillars: Grounded in Gospel Values and Local
          Realities</b>
        <br /><br />
        Rooted in the rich theological foundation shaped by Catholic Social
        Teaching and Deus Caritas Est, and guided by the practical mission of
        Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), four finely tuned Key Strategic Pillars have
        emerged. Each pillar is articulated through powerful expressions,
        accompanied by a clear Inspiration, Strategic Focus, and Key Actions.
        <br /><br />
        <b>3.1.Integral Human Development</b>
        <br /><br />
        Integral Human Development, grounded in Catholic Social Teaching,
        promotes the full dignity of every person by addressing injustice,
        advancing human rights, and fostering inclusion, especially for the
        poor and marginalized.

        <b>Conclusion: A Gospel-Inspired Path Toward Justice and
          Sustainability</b>
        <br /><br />
        This strategic plan is more than a blueprint for action. It is a
        statement of faith in action, a concrete expression of the Gospel in a
        wounded yet hopeful Sri Lankan society. Grounded in Catholic Social
        Teaching, enriched by global Caritas networks, and shaped by the
        voices of the poor, it calls us to serve with love, advocate with
        courage, and build communities where every person can flourish as the
        image of God.
        <br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka envisions a nation where dignity is upheld, charity
        is lived, empowerment is realized, peace is cultivated, and resilience
        is built — a vision that reflects not only the heart of the Church,
        but the heart of Christ Himself.
        <br /><br />
        “Everything is connected, and that genuine care for our own lives and
        our relationships with nature is inseparable from fraternity, justice
        and faithfulness to others.” <i>— Laudato Si’, §70.</i>

      <br /><br />
      <br /><br />

      <h1>Guiding Principles</h1>
      <p class="caritas-text">
        Our work is inspired and grounded in the values of Catholic Social
        Teaching, which uphold the dignity of every human being and the call
        to act with justice, compassion, and love.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Dignity of the Human Person</b>
        <br /><br />
        We affirm the inherent dignity and equality of every human life, from
        conception to natural death. We unequivocally reject the
        marginalization of the poor, persons with disabilities, the elderly,
        or any vulnerable members of the human family.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Mercy and Compassion</b>
        <br /><br />
        Rooted in the Gospel, mercy and compassion guide our mission. We are
        called to respond to suffering with love and action, walking alongside
        those in pain to restore hope and dignity.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Formation of the Heart</b>
        <br /><br />
        Charity is not only a professional duty but a vocation of love. Those
        who serve in our mission are called to a “formation of the heart,”
        dedicating themselves to others with deep empathy and a genuine
        commitment to human dignity. This formation complements and enriches
        professional training.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Equal Opportunities and Responsibilities</b>
        <br /><br />
        We promote the equal dignity, rights, and responsibilities of women
        and men, advocating for inclusive participation and shared leadership
        in every aspect of society.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Preferential Option for the Poor</b>
        <br /><br />
        We prioritize the needs of those who are poor, marginalized, or
        vulnerable. In solidarity with them, we work to challenge the root
        causes of poverty and injustice, helping to build a more equitable and
        compassionate world.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Universal Destination of the Goods of the Earth</b>
        <br /><br />
        We believe that the earth and its resources are meant for the benefit
        of all. We strive to transform unjust systems and structures so that
        everyone can share in the fruits of creation and enjoy their basic
        human rights.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Solidarity</b>
        <br /><br />
        We embrace the interconnectedness of the human family. By standing
        with the poor and advocating for the common good, we commit to
        building a more just and united world.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Subsidiarity and Cooperation</b>
        <br /><br />
        We uphold the principle of subsidiarity, respecting the autonomy of
        local communities while fostering cooperation across our global
        network. A united approach enables us to be more effective in
        advancing our shared mission.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Stewardship of Creation</b>
        <br /><br />
        The earth is a sacred trust, given for the benefit of all. As stewards
        of creation, we are committed to promoting sustainable practices and
        inspiring care for our common home, ensuring it remains a life-giving
        gift for generations to come.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Ethnic War- Rehabilitation</b>
        <br /><br />

        individuals.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Economic Crisis Mitigation Measures</b>
        <br /><br />
        The "Enhancing Resilience" program by CSL in Sri Lanka has provided
        vital support to those affected by the prolonged economic crisis. It
        has reached 40,808 families with food ration packs, assisted 27,514
        children with educational facilities, counseled 552 individuals,

        <br /><br />
        <b>Religious Amity</b>
        <br /><br />
        CSL has played a pivotal role in fostering a common vision of
        tolerance and harmony among all religions in Sri Lanka through
        initiatives aimed at changing public attitudes towards religious
        harmony for peacebuilding.CSL's exemplary approach to Religious Amity
        has garnered recognition, serving as a model for organizations and
        countries facing similar contexts. Sharing experiences with diverse
        groups like UNFPA, Agiamondo, and the University of Peradeniya,
        Caritas has fostered unity and dialogue.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Safe Migration</b>
        <br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka supports migrants at every stage—aspiring,
        in-service, and returnees—through legal aid, case management, and
        compensation facilitation. It addresses issues like contract
        violations, trafficking, and unpaid wages. Caritas also provides
        psychosocial support to migrant families and conducts awareness
        sessions on safe, legal migration. By collaborating with the Catholic
        Migration Commission, government bodies, and stakeholders, Caritas
        ensures rights protection and promotes informed migration practices
        for vulnerable communities across Sri Lanka.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Environment protection </b>
        <br /><br />
        CSL’s proactive engagement with stakeholders and communities through
        initiatives like the 'Stepping Stone to Safeguarding Sri Lanka's
        Natural Environment Project' demonstrates a commitment to
        environmental awareness and action, as seen in their extensive
        clean-up, solidarity, and tree planting campaigns. Through
        collaboration and media outreach, Caritas continues to champion
        environmental conservation and climate justice, setting a noteworthy
        precedent for sustainable development.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Promoting Justice and Peace</b>
        <br /><br />
        As the National Secretariat of the Justice, Peace, and Human
        Development Commission of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference, Caritas
        Sri Lanka plays a vital advocacy and educational role. It conducts
        awareness programs, study sessions, and campaigns on critical national
        issues such as elections, the 13th Amendment, the Anti-Terrorism Act,
        human rights, and social justice. Through these efforts, Caritas
        fosters democratic values, informed civic participation, and dialogue,
        promoting peace, justice, and human dignity across communities in Sri
        Lanka.
        <br /><br />
        <b>A Learning and Proactive Organisation</b>
        <br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka demonstrated its proactive and learning-oriented
        approach through its comprehensive response to the Easter Sunday
        attacks ( 21st April, 2019) offering psychosocial care, medical aid,
        financial and educational support, and interfaith healing.
        Simultaneously, it engaged in evidence-based advocacy, publishing
        research on plantation community welfare, migration challenges, and
        interreligious peacebuilding. By documenting lived realities and
        informing policy through data-driven insights, including the Sri Lanka
        country profile, Caritas advances sustainable development, social
        justice, and resilience-building across diverse and vulnerable
        communities.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <br /><br />

      <h1>Consolidated and elaborated SWOT Analysis:</h1>
      <p class="caritas-text">
        Caritas Sri Lanka’s distinctiveness anchored in its Catholic identity,
        Gospel mission, and Church mandate is not just symbolic but strategic.
        This uniqueness fosters deep-rooted trust, credibility, and community
        presence, enabling CSL to effectively navigate weaknesses such as
        limited visibility, resource dependency, and staff turnover. Amid
        growing external threats like political instability, religious
        intolerance, and funding volatility, CSL’s strengths mainly its
        ecclesial structure, interfaith engagement, and grassroots networks
        combined with emerging opportunities in youth engagement, digital
        tools, and strategic partnerships, empower it to sustain impact,
        uphold dignity, and transform vulnerable communities with resilience
        and faith-driven integrity.

        Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL) is committed to addressing the deep-rooted and
        evolving challenges in post-war Northern and Eastern regions, where
        trauma, youth unemployment, malnutrition, and weak governance persist.
        Similarly, plantation workers, fishing communities, and agricultural
        labourers continue to struggle with poverty, poor living conditions,
        lack of education, and limited livelihood opportunities. CSL
        recognizes that inclusive, locally contextualised and rights-based
        interventions are essential to building resilience, restoring dignity,
        and promoting sustainable peace and development across all
        marginalized and vulnerable communities in Sri Lanka.

      <h1>Country Context</h1>
      <p class="caritas-text">
        <b>Sri Lanka: Country Context and Regional Disparities</b>
        <br /><br />
        Sri Lanka, a strategically located island nation in South Asia, lies
        just south of India in the Indian Ocean. Commonly referred to as the
        "Pearl of the Indian Ocean," it is celebrated for its rich cultural
        heritage, ecological diversity, and resilient population. With a
        population of approximately 22 million, the country is home to three
        major ethnic groups Sinhalese, Tamils, and Moors and functions as a
        Democratic Socialist Republic. Colombo serves as the commercial
        capital, while Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is the administrative
        capital. The country has made significant development strides,
        especially following the end of a 30-year civil conflict in 2009.
        However, despite its progress, Sri Lanka faces acute socio-economic,
        political, and environmental challenges.
        <br /><br />
        Economically, the country relies heavily on services (nearly 60% of
        GDP), along with key sectors such as apparel, tourism, and
        agriculture. In 2022, Sri Lanka faced a historic economic collapse
        driven by foreign exchange shortages, soaring inflation, and debt
        default. Though a partial recovery began in 2023–2024, regional
        inequalities remain a significant barrier to inclusive growth.
        <br /><br />
        National-level indicators such as a 2023 Human Development Index (HDI)
        of 0.776 mask deep regional disparities. The Western Province, which
        includes Colombo, dominates economic output, contributing around 43.7%
        of GDP, with high HDI levels exceeding 0.80. It benefits from advanced
        infrastructure, ICT access, and employment opportunities, but also
        faces challenges such as urban poverty, congestion, and environmental
        stress.
        <br /><br />
        In contrast, the Plantation Region—home to a large Indian Tamil estate
        worker population—suffers chronic underdevelopment. Districts such as
        Nuwara Eliya and Badulla report HDI levels below 0.70, with widespread
        poverty, educational dropouts, and limited access to services. The
        Northern and Eastern Provinces, which were heavily affected by the
        civil war, continue to experience post-conflict challenges, including
        land disputes, unemployment, and weak institutional support.
        <br /><br />
        Addressing these disparities is vital for Sri Lanka’s long-term
        stability and development. A national strategy that integrates
        regional needs especially in conflict-affected, rural, and estate
        sectors—is essential to ensure equitable and sustainable progress for
        all Sri Lankans.

        <b>Rank</b>: 89/193 (UNDP 2023) <b>Note : </b> While
        <b>Colombo </b> exceeds national benchmarks, <b>Plantation</b> and
        <b>Northern/Eastern</b> regions fall significantly behind due to
        chronic underdevelopment, conflict legacy, and systemic inequality.
      </p>

      <b>Sri Lanka HDI Analysis – 2024 </b>
      <br /><br />

      <p class="caritas-text">
        In 2024, Sri Lanka retained its "high human development" status with
        an HDI score of 0.776, ranking 89th out of 193 countries, the highest
        in South Asia. Key strengths include life expectancy (75.9 years),
        high literacy (92%), mean years of schooling (10.8), and universal
        healthcare and education access, showcasing institutional resilience
        amid economic crises.
        <br /><br />
        However, the inequality-adjusted HDI drops by 18%, revealing sharp
        disparities. The richest 1% control 20.5% of income, while the bottom
        40% hold just 19%. Female labor force participation remains low (33%),
        despite strong educational parity. The Gender Development Index
        reflects a gap—male HDI: 0.795; female HDI: 0.755.
        <br /><br />
        GNI per capita (PPP) declined to below $11,500, while poverty surged
        to 24% post-2022 crisis. Real wages fell by up to 22%, and food
        insecurity affects 5 million people. An aging population (8.1% over
        65) and climate vulnerability (floods displacing 6,000 in 2024) add
        pressure to public systems. Digital inequality persists in rural,
        estate, and post-war regions, limiting access to digital services and
        opportunities.
        <br /><br />
        Addressing economic inequality, gender gaps, aging, climate
        resilience, and digital inclusion is critical to sustain and advance
        human development in Sri Lanka
      </p>

      <b>Impact of the Civil War and Post-War Context in Northern and Eastern
        Sri Lanka
      </b>
      <br /><br />
      Social and Psychological Impact
      <br /><br />

      <p class="caritas-text">
        The decades-long civil war (1983–2009) caused widespread displacement,
        loss of life, and the breakdown of family and community structures
        across the Northern and Eastern provinces, particularly in Mannar,
        Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vanni, and Batticaloa. More than 89,000 women
        were widowed, and countless children were orphaned or left with a
        single parent. Many women-headed households face severe socio-economic
        vulnerabilities and trauma. Post-conflict trauma remains largely
        unaddressed, with no systemic counselling support for war-affected
        individuals. The psychological effects—especially among youth born
        during the war—manifest in rising rates of suicide, substance abuse,
        family violence, and anti-social behaviour, weakening overall
        community cohesion.
        <br /><br />
        Economic Challenges
        <br /><br />
        Post-war economic recovery has been slow and uneven. Livelihoods
        centered on agriculture and fisheries remain underdeveloped due to
        damaged infrastructure, climate impacts, and lack of investment.
        Farmers face difficulties accessing irrigation and quality inputs,
        while fishing communities struggle with illegal fishing practices,
        destroyed mangroves, and unregulated aquaculture projects such as
        prawn and sea cucumber farms. Income insecurity is widespread,
        especially among women-headed households who often pawn assets to meet
        basic needs. Youth unemployment is high, pushing many into unsafe
        migration, drug use, or informal sectors. Micro-enterprises lack
        credit access and market linkages, while opportunities for value
        addition and collective production remain underutilized.
        <br /><br />
        Governance and Institutional Gaps
        <br /><br />
        Weak institutional capacity continues to hinder post-war recovery.
        Civil society organizations (CBOs) are under-resourced and lack the
        ability to influence policy or facilitate community development. Local
        governance structures often fail to deliver basic services such as
        healthcare, housing, water, and transport—especially in newly
        resettled and remote areas. Land disputes, unresolved cases of missing
        persons, and the continued detention of political prisoners have
        eroded trust in political processes. Disillusionment with traditional
        political parties has led to growing support for reform-oriented
        movements that emphasize accountability, justice, and inclusive
        development.
        <br /><br />
        Cultural and Inter-Communal Tensions
        <br /><br />
        Despite official narratives of peace, ethnic and religious divisions
        continue to undermine reconciliation. The post-war period saw renewed
        tensions between Tamil, Muslim, Sinhalese, and Christian communities,
        particularly after incidents like the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks in
        Batticaloa. Religious sites have become flashpoints for conflict,
        often exacerbated by political manipulation and lack of interfaith
        engagement. Cultural erosion, stigmatization of widows and
        ex-combatants, and lack of culturally grounded reconciliation
        processes further deepen divides and threaten long-term social
        harmony.
        <br /><br />
        Environmental and Disaster Vulnerability
        <br /><br />
        Environmental degradation poses a growing threat to sustainable
        development in the region. Climate change has led to erratic rainfall,
        frequent droughts, and flash floods that disrupt agriculture, displace
        communities, and destroy infrastructure. In Mannar Island, large-scale
        wind power and mineral sand mining projects are threatening
        biodiversity, ecosystems, and traditional livelihoods. The Vankalai
        Sanctuary, a critical site for migratory birds, is under threat due to
        poorly managed development, with limited environmental safeguards in
        place.
        <br /><br />
        Education and Youth Development
        <br /><br />
        Education remains a key challenge in post-war recovery. War
        disruptions, poverty, and trauma have led to high dropout rates,
        especially among youth. The current economic crisis has further forced
        many children out of school, particularly in rural areas. Schools
        suffer from poor infrastructure, understaffing, and lack of
        psychosocial support. Many youth lack skills and access to higher
        education or vocational training, limiting their employment
        opportunities and fueling frustration, migration, and social unrest.
        Investment in education is critical to break the cycle of poverty and
        rebuild war-affected communities.

      <b>Contemporary Forms of Slavery Affecting Malaiyaha Tamils in Sri
        Lanka</b>
      <br /><br />
      <b><i>(Summary based on the report by Mr. Tomoya Obokata, Special
          Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, UN Human Rights
          Council, A/HRC/51/26/Add.1)</i></b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        In his official visit to Sri Lanka from 26 November to 3 December
        2021, Mr. Tomoya Obokata, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on
        contemporary forms of slavery, revealed persistent structural and
        systemic inequalities affecting the Malaiyaha Tamil community. Brought
        from India over two centuries ago to work on British-run plantations,
        this community continues to face widespread discrimination,
        exploitative labour practices, and social exclusion. The Rapporteur’s
        findings highlight the urgent need for structural reforms and
        inclusive development.
      </p>

      <b>Labour Exploitation and Inhumane Living Conditions</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        Malaiyaha Tamils remain highly vulnerable to contemporary forms of
        slavery, especially in smaller private plantations where bonded labour
        persists. Workers are often unable to leave due to debts owed to
        estate owners. Although wages were officially increased to LKR 1,000
        per day in 2021, this gain was undermined by management practices such
        as increasing daily output targets and applying arbitrary wage
        deductions. These practices contribute to conditions that amount to
        forced labour and, in some cases, serfdom.
        <br /><br />
        Housing conditions further entrench this exploitation. The community
        continues to live in colonial-era line houses, often without land
        ownership rights. These structures—typically 10 x 12 feet—house 5 to
        10 individuals and lack basic infrastructure like windows, kitchens,
        running water, and electricity. Families often share communal
        latrines. Despite numerous requests to estate management, improvements
        remain minimal, and civil society organizations attempting to assist
        the community have reportedly faced harassment and surveillance.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Limited Access to Services and Systemic Discrimination</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        <br /><br />
        Healthcare access within plantations is critically inadequate. Many
        dispensaries are staffed by unqualified personnel, and no nearby
        hospitals exist, making emergency care both inaccessible and
        unaffordable. Government social welfare programs are reportedly
        implemented in name but seldom reach plantation communities.
        <br /><br />
        Although some housing projects—including those supported by the Indian
        government—have been initiated, affordability is a major concern.
        Workers may be forced to take out large loans to access better
        housing, perpetuating cycles of debt and economic vulnerability.
        <br /><br />
        A major barrier to justice and public service access is language
        discrimination. While both Tamil and Sinhala are official languages,
        many public officials use only Sinhala, making it difficult for
        Tamil-speaking workers to report abuses or access legal remedies. This
        linguistic divide also contributes to broader inequality in access to
        education, employment, and state services.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Youth, Education, and the Future of the Community</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        Many young Malaiyaha Tamils reject plantation work due to its
        exploitative nature, yet decent employment alternatives are scarce.
        Discrimination and limited access to vocational education mean most
        end up in informal sectors such as domestic work, cleaning, retail, or
        even sex work—roles often marked by precariousness and exploitation.
        <br /><br />
        Education, though legally integrated into the national system since
        1975, remains substandard. The literacy rate in plantation sectors is
        just 66%, compared to 92% in urban areas. COVID-19 worsened this gap.
        The shift to online learning left many children behind due to lack of
        internet access and inability to afford smartphones or computers.
        <br /><br />
        The report reveals a deeply entrenched system of ethnically rooted
        inequality and labour exploitation affecting the Malaiyaha Tamil
        community. Addressing these injustices requires not only immediate
        policy reforms but also a commitment to inclusive, rights-based
        development that centers the voices and needs of marginalized groups.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Social Context in Sri Lanka: National Overview with Regional
        Disparities</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        Sri Lanka has made notable progress in human development, particularly
        in education and healthcare. With a national literacy rate of 95.7%
        and life expectancy averaging 76 years, the country performs well on
        many social indicators. These achievements are largely attributed to
        its universal healthcare system and free public education. However,
        beneath this national progress lie deep regional inequalities that
        affect vulnerable groups disproportionately.
        <br /><br />
        Urban centers like <b>Colombo</b> in the Western Province enjoy high
        levels of social development, with widespread access to healthcare,
        education, and digital services. Yet, even in urban areas, growing
        inequality is evident through rising slum populations and social
        exclusion. In Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, youth unemployment,
        caste-based discrimination, and out-migration persist. Anuradhapura
        also grapples with high incidences of chronic kidney disease (CKDu)
        and malnutrition, particularly in rural areas. <br /><br />
        The Plantation Region, especially Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and
        Ratnapura, faces severe socio-economic deficits. Estate workers,
        primarily Indian Tamil communities, live in overcrowded line houses
        with poor sanitation and limited transport access. Educational dropout
        rates are high after primary school due to poverty and cultural
        constraints. Health concerns such as malnutrition, maternal mortality,
        tuberculosis, and HIV remain prevalent.
        <br /><br />
        In the Northern and Eastern Provinces—including Jaffna, Mannar,
        Kilinochchi, Batticaloa, and Trincomalee—the legacy of civil war
        continues to impact social cohesion. Vanni suffers from widespread
        trauma, school dropouts, and drug abuse. Mannar and Batticaloa face
        early marriage, inter-ethnic tensions, and child labor. Access to
        healthcare is inadequate in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, while
        Trincomalee struggles with ethnic segregation in schools.
        <br /><br />
        Gender disparities also compound social challenges. 25% of households
        are female-headed, many due to war widowhood, and districts like
        Ampara report female labor force participation as low as 17.1%. These
        households often lack access to land, income, and social protection.
        <br /><br />
        Sri Lanka’s impressive national averages conceal significant regional
        divides. Addressing these disparities—particularly in estate, rural,
        and post-conflict regions—is essential for ensuring equitable and
        sustainable social development across the country.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Economic Context: National Overview with Regional Disparities</b>
        <br /><br />
        Sri Lanka, a strategically located island in the Indian Ocean, is
        undergoing a fragile yet steady economic recovery following its
        historic collapse in 2022. The crisis driven by foreign exchange
        shortages, unsustainable debt, and poor fiscal governance exposed deep
        structural weaknesses in the economy. In response, the government
        secured a USD 2.9 billion IMF bailout in 2023, followed by a critical
        USD 12.55 billion debt restructuring in late 2024, which restored some
        investor confidence, stabilized the currency, and brought inflation
        under control. By 2025, GDP growth has resumed cautiously, with
        forecasts of 5% growth, although economic vulnerabilities persist.
        <br /><br />
        The economic structure is moderately diversified. The services sector
        contributes around 60% of GDP, led by tourism, ICT, logistics, and
        finance. The industrial sector, contributing 26%, is anchored in
        garments and apparel exports, while agriculture, though reduced to
        7.5–8% of GDP, remains essential for food security and rural
        employment. Remittances and tourism remain critical foreign exchange
        sources, while export-import imbalances and high external debt—USD
        57.2 billion or ~57.8% of GDP—pose ongoing challenges.
        <br /><br />
        According to the labor force survey 2022 data, 49.8% of the
        working-age population (8.5 million) is economically active, with
        approximately 65.3% male and 34.7% female, or around 5.6 million and 3
        million, respectively. The highest number of economically active
        labour is in the Rural sector, which is nearly 76%. The corresponding
        figures for the Urban and Estate sectors are 16% and 5% respectively.
        <br /><br />
        Regional economic disparities sharply shape development outcomes. The
        Western Province, particularly Colombo, contributes over 41–46% of
        national GDP, benefiting from infrastructure such as the Colombo Port,
        Port City, and vibrant startup ecosystems. In contrast, Kurunegala and
        Anuradhapura depend on subsistence agriculture and informal labor,
        with incomes vulnerable to climate shocks and limited industrial
        diversification. Chilaw’s economy revolves around fishing and coconut
        farming, constrained by poor market access and limited technological
        integration.
        <br /><br />
        The Plantation Region remains economically marginalized. Despite being
        central to tea production, workers face low wages, high youth
        unemployment, and limited access to vocational or digital skills.
        Microfinance debt burdens many, especially women, worsening economic
        precarity.
        <br /><br />
        In the Northern and Eastern Provinces economic revival post-conflict
        has been uneven. Agriculture and fisheries dominate, but are undercut
        by illegal fishing, environmental degradation, and weak private
        investment. While Jaffna shows potential in ICT and small-scale
        apparel, centralized economic planning and military control over
        assets hinder growth. Youth unemployment surpasses 30% in several
        districts.
        <br /><br />
        These imbalances directly impact HDI indicators by suppressing income
        levels, limiting access to services, and constraining equitable
        economic participation. Addressing them requires decentralization,
        inclusive planning, and targeted regional investment to ensure
        sustainable, broad-based growth.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Climate Vulnerability and Agriculture: National and Regional
        Context</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        Sri Lanka, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, is highly vulnerable
        to climate change due to its geographic location and socio-economic
        dependence on climate-sensitive sectors. Approximately 50% of its 22
        million population resides in low-lying coastal areas, making them
        highly exposed to sea-level rise, storm surges, and salinity
        intrusion. The country frequently experiences extreme weather events,
        including floods, droughts, and landslides, with increasing intensity
        and unpredictability. These shifts pose serious risks to
        infrastructure, biodiversity, and human health, with direct
        repercussions on national development and HDI outcomes.
        <br /><br />
        Agriculture, while contributing only 7.5–8% of GDP, remains a critical
        source of livelihood for a large portion of the rural population.
        However, changing rainfall patterns have disrupted traditional monsoon
        cycles, particularly in the dry and intermediate zones, affecting
        regions like Anuradhapura and Kurunegala, where farmers now struggle
        with irrigation stress and crop failures. Prolonged droughts in the
        North Central Province have increased the incidence of chronic kidney
        disease linked to contaminated water sources. In Chilaw, saltwater
        intrusion and erratic coastal weather further reduce arable land and
        threaten fishing-based livelihoods.
        <br /><br />
        In the Plantation Region, notably Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and
        Ratnapura—the impacts of climate change are felt through rising
        temperatures, landslides, and soil erosion, threatening tea production
        and local settlements. Poor land management, chemical runoff, and
        limited adoption of climate-smart practices exacerbate environmental
        degradation. While some estates have piloted organic farming and
        agroforestry, these remain under-resourced and poorly scaled.
        <br /><br />
        In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, already struggling from the
        legacy of conflict, environmental degradation is acute. Mannar and
        Mullaitivu face severe soil erosion and mine-contaminated lands that
        remain unsuitable for cultivation. In Kilinochchi and Batticaloa,
        water scarcity and deforestation undermine both agriculture and
        community resilience. Trincomalee suffers from illegal fishing,
        coastal degradation, and a loss of mangroves that previously buffered
        climate shocks.
        <br /><br />
        Across all regions, post-harvest losses, pest outbreaks, and market
        inaccessibility remain significant barriers. Without urgent investment
        in climate-resilient agriculture, early warning systems, and
        community-based adaptation, these environmental pressures will
        continue to erode food security, income stability, and public health,
        thus undermining HDI progress in already marginalized areas
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Technological Context: National and Regional Disparities in Sri
        Lanka</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        Sri Lanka’s technological landscape is evolving rapidly, particularly
        in the services sector, where ICT and telecommunications contribute
        significantly to the nearly 60% share of GDP. The country has gained
        international recognition for its growing IT and BPM (Business Process
        Management) exports, supported by investments in digital platforms
        across governance, education, and healthcare. Urban centers,
        especially Colombo, benefit from 4G/5G connectivity, smart
        infrastructure projects under the Megapolis plan, and thriving
        fintech, e-governance, and AI ecosystems. These advancements have
        improved administrative efficiency, expanded digital employment, and
        enhanced citizen access to services.
        <br /><br />
        However, Sri Lanka faces a widening digital divide, especially in
        rural, estate, and conflict-affected regions. In districts like
        Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, digital infrastructure remains
        underdeveloped, with inconsistent broadband access in schools and
        homes. Chilaw, with its coastal isolation, suffers from severe digital
        exclusion, impeding access to e-learning and online services. The
        Plantation Region shows the deepest digital marginalization, where
        low-income estate workers lack affordable internet, digital skills,
        and devices, creating barriers to education and livelihoods.
        <br /><br />
        In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, Jaffna has made moderate
        progress through ICT centers and university-led initiatives. Yet,
        districts like Mannar, Mullaitivu, and Batticaloa continue to lag due
        to weak connectivity, language constraints, and low uptake of digital
        training. Though pilot programs in smart agriculture and community ICT
        centres exist, they remain limited in reach and impact.
        <br /><br />
        Technological underdevelopment constrains human capital formation,
        particularly in education and employment. The lack of inclusive access
        to digital tools and training widens regional and income-based
        inequalities, directly affecting HDI components such as knowledge and
        income. Bridging this gap is essential for equitable development and
        long-term resilience in a tech-driven global economy.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Political Context: National Overview with Regional Disparities in Sri
        Lanka</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        <br /><br />
        Sri Lanka’s political environment remains complex and fluid, shaped by
        decades of civil conflict and recent economic crises. The 2022
        economic collapse triggered widespread protests, undermining public
        trust and culminating in a major leadership change highlighting urgent
        efforts to consolidate power and drive reforms amid ongoing governance
        challenges.
        <br /><br />
        Governance in Sri Lanka remains highly centralized, with Colombo as
        the dominant hub for policymaking and resource distribution. This
        centralization facilitates national coordination but deepens regional
        inequalities. The Western Region, especially Colombo, benefits from
        stronger infrastructure, better services, and political influence. In
        contrast, rural and peri-urban areas such as Kurunegala, Anuradhapura,
        and Chilaw face political marginalization and elite capture, limiting
        equitable development despite Chilaw’s location in a relatively
        prosperous province.
        <br /><br />
        Post-conflict Northern and Eastern Provinces continue to experience
        weak local autonomy under centralized control. Districts like
        Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Batticaloa confront slow recovery,
        ongoing militarization, unresolved land disputes, and minimal
        resettlement. Demographic shifts in Mannar and Trincomalee generate
        social tensions, while Jaffna, the Tamil cultural heartland, remains
        politically distanced from Colombo’s power structures. Political
        marginalization is also acute in the Plantation Region, where the
        Indian Tamil community in districts such as Nuwara Eliya and Badulla
        suffers from disconnected representation, inconsistent policies, and
        weak labor unions.
        <br /><br />
        These patterns of centralized governance, elite dominance, and
        regional political exclusion directly hinder equitable resource access
        and service delivery, suppressing human development outcomes across
        Sri Lanka’s diverse regions.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Legal Context: National Overview with Regional Disparities in Sri
        Lanka</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        <br /><br />
        Sri Lanka’s legal framework supports key development goals, including
        labor rights, environmental protection, and gender equality, with laws
        such as the 2016 minimum wage and climate adaptation policies.
        However, uneven implementation across rural, estate, and marginalized
        communities limits their impact. The coexistence of civil, personal,
        and customary laws—known as legal pluralism—creates enforcement
        challenges, especially in gender justice. Although legal protections
        against domestic violence and equal marriage age exist, variations in
        application among ethnic and religious groups restrict women’s access
        to justice.
        <br /><br />
        Judicial independence and efficiency remain critical issues
        nationwide. Court backlogs, low legal literacy, and perceived
        political interference undermine timely justice. Environmental and
        land-use laws, though comprehensive on paper, suffer from weak
        enforcement, particularly in informal settlements and ecologically
        sensitive areas.
        <br /><br />
        Regionally, Colombo in the Western Province benefits from stronger
        institutions and more effective enforcement of urban, environmental,
        and labour laws, including the Urban Development Authority Act and
        Coast Conservation Act. In contrast, districts like Kurunegala,
        Anuradhapura, and Chilaw experience poor enforcement of land tenure,
        labour protections, and environmental regulations. In Chilaw,
        fisherfolk and estate workers often lack formal property rights,
        increasing vulnerability and exclusion from legal protections.
        <br /><br />
        The Plantation Region, faces inconsistent enforcement of the
        Plantation Labour Act. Estate workers remain largely landless, trapped
        in cycles of economic dependency without legal ownership or asset
        accumulation. Environmental laws under the National Environmental Act
        are also poorly applied, enabling land degradation.
        <br /><br />
        In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, land disputes critically hinder
        development. Tamil returnees in Kilinochchi and Mannar face contested
        claims from state agencies and settlers, while limited legal aid in
        Mullaitivu aggravates exclusion. Military occupation and religious
        land disputes, especially in Trincomalee, further weaken trust in the
        legal system and obstruct effective resettlement and environmental
        protections.
        <br /><br />
        Legal insecurity, weak land rights, and enforcement gaps significantly
        undermine social equity, sustainable livelihoods, and human
        development outcomes across Sri Lanka.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <b>Gender Overview of Sri Lanka: National Context and Regional
        Disparities</b>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        <br /><br />
        Sri Lanka has made notable strides in gender equality, particularly in
        education. Female literacy rates are impressively high, ranging from
        90% to 96%, positioning the country among South Asia’s leaders in
        female educational attainment, according to Caritas Sri Lanka. This
        achievement reflects sustained government investments and societal
        valuing of girls’ education. However, despite these educational gains,
        gender disparities persist in economic participation and social
        empowerment, underscoring complex socio-cultural barriers that
        continue to limit women’s full inclusion in public and economic life.
        <br /><br />
        Labor force participation reveals one of the starkest gender gaps in
        Sri Lanka. While male participation exceeds 75%, female participation
        hovers around 35%, as reported by the Institute of Applied Statistics
        Sri Lanka (IASSL). This disparity is shaped by entrenched social
        norms, caregiving burdens, and constrained access to formal
        employment. Regionally, these differences are more pronounced.
        Districts such as Ampara report female labor force participation as
        low as 17.1%, reflecting traditional and rural settings where
        conservative gender roles prevail. Conversely, Nuwara Eliya shows a
        relatively higher rate of 45.8%, highlighting the influence of estate
        communities where women often engage in agricultural labor, albeit
        under informal conditions.
        <br /><br />
        Vulnerabilities linked to gender are also intensified by
        socio-political histories and household dynamics. Approximately 25% of
        Sri Lankan households are female-headed, many a consequence of
        war-related widowhood, especially in conflict-affected districts like
        Batticaloa in the Eastern Province. These female-headed households
        frequently face economic insecurity, lack adequate social protection,
        and experience marginalization in local governance and decision-making
        processes. Such challenges are exacerbated in rural and estate
        sectors, where institutional support remains weak and poverty levels
        are high, limiting women’s access to livelihoods and social services.
        <br /><br />
        Health and safety indicators present a mixed picture. Women generally
        enjoy higher life expectancy—76.9 years for females versus 71.3 years
        for males (IASSL)—yet face elevated risks of gender-based violence
        (GBV), including domestic abuse and sexual harassment. Older women in
        estate communities face compounded vulnerabilities due to economic
        marginalization and limited healthcare access. Additionally, the
        coexistence of multiple legal systems—civil, customary, and
        religious—creates complexities that often undermine women’s rights and
        protection, particularly in rural and minority communities, limiting
        their recourse against discrimination and abuse.
        <br /><br />
        In summary, while Sri Lanka exhibits strong educational gender
        achievements, economic, social, and legal disparities persist, with
        significant regional variations. Addressing these challenges requires
        targeted policy interventions focusing on enhancing women’s economic
        opportunities, strengthening social safety nets for vulnerable groups,
        combating gender-based violence, and harmonizing legal frameworks to
        ensure equitable protection and empowerment of all women across the
        nation.

      <p class="caritas-text">
        <strong>Quality Education – Building Foundations for Dignity and
          Inclusion</strong><br /><br />
        In Sri Lanka’s war-affected Northern and Eastern provinces, education
        remains a vital pillar for rebuilding communities and breaking cycles
        of poverty. Decades of conflict severely disrupted schooling, leaving
        many children out of school due to destroyed infrastructure, teacher
        shortages, economic hardship, and psychosocial trauma. These factors
        are worsened by parental migration and poverty, especially affecting
        girls and children from vulnerable families. Without access to quality
        education, these children face limited opportunities and risk falling
        into exploitative situations. Additionally, inadequate transportation
        and language barriers further isolate remote communities, hindering
        equitable access.<br /><br />
        CSL promotes comprehensive education programs that support school
        rehabilitation, teacher training, psychosocial care, and the
        integration of life skills, peace education, and leadership
        development. By emphasizing value-based education, CSL nurtures moral
        and civic responsibility among youth, preparing them as future leaders
        in their communities.<br /><br />
        This approach helps children grow not only academically but also as
        responsible citizens capable of contributing to peace and development.
        Through these efforts, CSL aims to break poverty cycles and create
        inclusive communities where children have equal chances to succeed,
        fostering long-term social transformation and community resilience.<br /><br />

        <strong>Livelihood & Economic Empowerment – Restoring Dignity and
          Resilience</strong><br /><br />
        Post-war economic recovery in Sri Lanka’s North and East remains
        fragile, with many communities facing limited livelihood options and
        persistent poverty. Displacement, fractured markets, and social
        exclusion have left war widows, returnees, youth, and women especially
        vulnerable. Access to capital, vocational training, and sustainable
        income-generating opportunities is scarce, trapping many in cycles of
        dependency. Climate change and environmental degradation also threaten
        traditional agriculture and fisheries, compounding economic
        vulnerabilities.<br /><br />
        CSL’s livelihood programs address these challenges by providing
        vocational training aligned with market demands, microfinance support,
        cooperative enterprise development, and climate-smart agricultural
        practices. These interventions enable marginalized groups to build
        sustainable livelihoods, reduce economic vulnerability, and strengthen
        social cohesion. By fostering entrepreneurship and cooperative models,
        CSL helps communities create collective economic strength, enhancing
        bargaining power and resilience.<br /><br />
        By fostering self-reliance and community empowerment, CSL helps
        restore hope and economic dignity. Their inclusive approach builds
        resilient economies that can withstand shocks, supporting broader
        peace and development goals. Ultimately, economic empowerment
        strengthens families’ ability to meet basic needs and invest in the
        future.

        <strong>Health & Nutrition – Promoting Holistic Wellbeing</strong><br /><br />
        Health challenges in Sri Lanka’s conflict-affected and impoverished
        regions remain acute. High rates of malnutrition, chronic diseases,
        mental health issues, and poor access to clean water and sanitation
        threaten vulnerable populations. The war’s legacy, combined with
        poverty and environmental stressors, contributes to physical and
        psychosocial distress, especially among women, children, and
        returnees. Malnutrition affects child development and increases
        susceptibility to illness, while mental health remains largely
        unaddressed due to stigma and limited services.<br /><br />
        CSL’s health outreach prioritizes holistic care encompassing medical
        services, nutrition-sensitive interventions, WASH improvements, and
        trauma-informed psychosocial support. Mobile clinics, health
        education, and community-based counseling help address immediate needs
        while promoting long-term wellbeing. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture
        and home gardening initiatives improve food security and dietary
        diversity in vulnerable households.<br /><br />
        By tackling physical health alongside mental and emotional care, CSL
        strengthens community resilience and human flourishing. Improved
        health outcomes and increased awareness empower communities to
        overcome vulnerabilities and build a foundation for sustainable
        development and dignity.<br /><br />

        <strong>Environmental Protection & Climate Resilience – Sustaining
          Livelihoods and Ecosystems</strong><br /><br />
        Sri Lanka faces escalating environmental challenges including climate
        change impacts, deforestation, and pollution. These issues
        disproportionately affect poor rural and estate communities dependent
        on natural resources. Crop failures, water scarcity, and environmental
        degradation threaten food security and livelihoods, deepening poverty.
        Unsustainable land use and poor waste management exacerbate ecosystem
        decline, with long-term consequences for biodiversity and human
        health.<br /><br />
        CSL works with local communities to promote environmental stewardship
        through reforestation, organic farming, renewable energy use, waste
        reduction, and climate adaptation training. These initiatives restore
        ecosystems while supporting eco-friendly income generation and
        resilience. Emphasizing local knowledge and participatory approaches,
        CSL fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility for sustainable
        natural resource management.<br /><br />
        By empowering communities to manage natural resources sustainably, CSL
        helps safeguard livelihoods and enhances climate preparedness. This
        integrated approach fosters a healthier environment and more secure
        futures, especially for marginalized populations vulnerable to
        ecological shocks.<br /><br />

        <strong>Disaster Risk Reduction & Anticipatory Action – Building Community
          Resilience</strong><br /><br />
        Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to natural disasters—floods, droughts,
        landslides, and pandemics—exposes poor communities to recurrent shocks
        that disrupt livelihoods and deepen poverty. Inadequate infrastructure
        and limited emergency preparedness exacerbate the risks faced by
        rural, estate, and coastal populations. The growing frequency and
        severity of disasters linked to climate change highlight the urgency
        of proactive resilience-building.<br /><br />
        CSL prioritizes disaster risk reduction by establishing community
        disaster management committees, early warning systems, preparedness
        planning, and sustainable natural resource management. These proactive
        measures enhance community capacity to respond to emergencies with
        strength and dignity. Training local leaders and promoting inclusive
        participation ensure that vulnerable groups, including women and
        children, are actively involved in risk reduction.<br /><br />
        Shifting from reactive aid to anticipatory action, CSL’s approach
        reduces disaster losses and accelerates recovery. Strengthening local
        leadership and resilience ensures that vulnerable families are better
        protected and can maintain stability amid crises.<br /><br />

        <strong>Peacebuilding, Justice & Social Cohesion – Healing and Inclusive
          Development</strong><br /><br />
        Despite the end of Sri Lanka’s civil war in 2009, social wounds
        persist, particularly in the North and East. Ethnic tensions, land
        disputes, lack of accountability, and exclusion from governance hinder
        reconciliation and development. Marginalized groups—including women,
        youth, and minorities—face barriers to justice and participation,
        while issues like domestic violence and political radicalization
        threaten social stability.<br /><br />
        CSL’s peacebuilding work fosters dialogue, trauma-informed
        psychosocial support, legal empowerment, and civic engagement to
        promote nonviolence and social cohesion. By facilitating inter-ethnic
        and interreligious communication and empowering local leaders, CSL
        helps communities heal and rebuild trust. Initiatives include peace
        education in schools and support for victim advocacy groups.<br /><br />
        These efforts contribute to more inclusive governance and stronger
        justice systems, enabling marginalized groups to actively participate
        in shaping their futures. The goal is a reconciled society where
        diversity is respected and peace is sustained, laying the foundation
        for lasting development.

        persist, particularly in the North and East. Ethnic tensions, land
        disputes, lack of accountability, and exclusion from governance hinder
        reconciliation and development. Marginalized groups—including women,
        youth, and minorities—face barriers to justice and participation,
        while issues like domestic violence and political radicalization
        threaten social stability.<br /><br />
        CSL’s peacebuilding work fosters dialogue, trauma-informed
        psychosocial support, legal empowerment, and civic engagement to
        promote nonviolence and social cohesion. By facilitating inter-ethnic
        and interreligious communication and empowering local leaders, CSL
        helps communities heal and rebuild trust. Initiatives include peace
        education in schools and support for victim advocacy groups.<br /><br />
        These efforts contribute to more inclusive governance and stronger
        justice systems, enabling marginalized groups to actively participate
        in shaping their futures. The goal is a reconciled society where
        diversity is respected and peace is sustained, laying the foundation
        for lasting development.<br /><br />

        <strong>Safe Migration & Reintegration – Protecting Migrants and
          Strengthening Families</strong><br /><br />
        Migration for work is a significant socio-economic factor in Sri
        Lanka, yet many migrants—especially women—face unsafe conditions,
        exploitation, and family separation. Returnees often encounter stigma,
        trauma, and economic hardship without adequate reintegration support.
        Children left behind face emotional and educational challenges.<br /><br />
        CSL’s programs address these challenges by providing pre-departure
        education, legal awareness, and community-based support to promote
        safe migration practices. They also assist returnees with livelihood
        training, psychosocial counseling, and access to social protection
        services. Advocacy efforts focus on improving legal frameworks and
        ethical recruitment practices.<br /><br />
        By raising awareness, advocating for migrant rights, and supporting
        sustainable reintegration, CSL reduces vulnerabilities associated with
        migration. This holistic approach helps families maintain unity,
        rebuild economic stability, and enhances community resilience,
        contributing to safer, more dignified migration experiences.<br /><br />

        <strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka’s work across these thematic areas responds directly
        to the multifaceted challenges faced by poor and marginalized
        communities, especially in post-conflict and vulnerable regions. By
        integrating education, livelihood, health, environment, disaster
        preparedness, peacebuilding, and migration support, CSL promotes
        holistic, sustainable development rooted in dignity and empowerment.
        These interventions address immediate needs and systemic barriers,
        fostering resilience, social inclusion, and hope. CSL’s comprehensive
        approach advances its vision of integral human development and a just
        society where all can flourish with dignity, security, and
        opportunity.

        <strong>Analysis of CSL’s Strategic Alignment with National Development
          Plans</strong><br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), as a responsible civil society actor, is not
        a political entity nor a recipient of IMF funding. However, in its
        strategic planning, CSL seeks coherence with national development
        priorities to meaningfully contribute to the country’s recovery
        process. This alignment does not imply obligation, but rather reflects
        CSL’s commitment to promoting ethical, inclusive development. It also
        strengthens the strategic plan’s relevance and provides a focused
        framework for effective programming and coherent fundraising
        support.<br /><br />
        Sri Lanka’s IMF-led economic restructuring under the Extended Fund
        Facility (EFF) represents a pivotal moment in its recovery from the
        severe economic crisis. Centered on debt restructuring, fiscal
        consolidation, governance reforms, and foreign currency stabilization,
        the initiative seeks to restore macroeconomic stability and foster
        sustainable growth. However, the reform process must be sensitive to
        the needs of the country’s most vulnerable populations, ensuring that
        economic recovery does not come at the cost of social justice and
        equity.<br /><br />
        In this transformative context, Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), as a national
        faith-based organization committed to integral human development, is
        already aligned in its development strategies with the priorities of
        the economic restructuring. With a long-standing grassroots presence,
        thematic expertise, and a mission rooted in human dignity, CSL can
        help ensure that the restructuring process translates into inclusive
        and people-centered development. The strategic plan takes this into
        consideration in order to strategize its future project planning which
        take into consideration the national priorities.<br /><br />

        <strong>Strategic Alignment with IMF Priorities</strong><br /><br />
        CSL’s rights-based, community-driven strategic approach is directly in
        coherence with the priorities of the IMF program which emphasizes
        targeted social protection, transparent governance, and inclusive
        development to cushion the social impact of economic reforms. Its role
        is not only supportive but catalytic—amplifying state-led initiatives
        and advocating for equitable resource allocation, particularly for
        marginalized communities at risk of being left behind during fiscal
        consolidation.<br /><br />

        <strong>Responding to the Needs of Vulnerable Groups</strong><br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka’s programming reaches a wide spectrum of vulnerable
        groups, including internally displaced persons, war-affected families,
        women-headed households, persons with disabilities, migrant workers
        and returnees, ethnic and religious minorities, and communities
        affected by environmental degradation and poverty. These populations
        are among those most exposed to the consequences of austerity
        measures, making CSL’s interventions vital in buffering negative
        impacts.
      </p>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        <strong>CSL Thematic Focus and National Goals Coherence</strong><br /><br />

        <strong>Promoting Quality Education:</strong> As public spending
        tightens, access to quality education becomes more fragile especially
        in rural, estate, and conflict-affected areas. CSL addresses this
        through scholarships, supplementary learning programs, and
        psychosocial support, ensuring continuity in education for children
        from disadvantaged backgrounds and reinforcing the IMF’s call to
        protect essential public services.<br /><br />

        <strong>Livelihood and Economic Empowerment:</strong> Economic
        uncertainty has intensified joblessness and income insecurity. CSL’s
        livelihood programs, including microenterprise development, vocational
        training, and financial literacy—particularly targeting women, youth,
        coastal and plantation workers—support household resilience and align
        with the IMF’s objective of productive fiscal spending and economic
        diversification.<br /><br />

        <strong>Health and Nutrition:</strong> Budgetary constraints risk
        diminishing healthcare access. CSL addresses this by delivering
        community-based health and nutrition interventions for chronically ill
        individuals, malnourished children, pregnant women, and the
        elderly—ensuring continuity of essential care where state services may
        fall short.<br /><br />

        <strong>Environmental Protection and Climate Resilience:</strong>
        Through initiatives such as sustainable farming, reforestation, water
        conservation, and eco-education, CSL contributes to climate adaptation
        and environmental stewardship. These programs align with national
        priorities like the Clean Sri Lanka initiative and with the IMF’s
        long-term sustainability goals.<br /><br />

        <strong>Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Anticipatory Action:</strong>
        In times of fiscal tightening, disaster recovery becomes more
        challenging. CSL builds local capacity for preparedness and response,
        reducing future recovery costs and safeguarding lives and livelihoods
        through early warning systems, community risk assessments, and
        resilience-building programs.<br /><br />

        <strong>Peacebuilding, Justice, and Social Cohesion:</strong> Social
        and economic inequalities risk fueling unrest, particularly in
        post-conflict regions. CSL promotes reconciliation, interfaith
        dialogue, and civic participation, helping build trust in
        institutions.<br /><br />

        <strong>Safe Migration and Reintegration:</strong> Given the rise in
        labor migration, CSL provides legal aid, reintegration services, and
        skills training for returnees and migrant families. This ensures that
        remittances, a key pillar of Sri Lanka’s foreign earnings, translate
        into long-term local development.<br /><br />

        <strong>Strengthening Social Protection Mechanisms</strong>
        <br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka supports the development of more inclusive and
        effective safety nets by:
      </p>

      <ul style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          Identifying and prioritizing the most vulnerable beneficiaries
          through community-based assessments;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Monitoring outreach and effectiveness of public welfare programs;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Offering technical support for improving policy responsiveness;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Providing data and feedback loops to inform real-time policy
          adjustments.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="caritas-text">
        This grassroots approach enhances the targeting, adequacy, and
        transparency of social welfare systems, reinforcing the IMF’s goal of
        minimizing the social cost of fiscal reforms.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Promoting Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration</strong><br /><br />
      CSL can facilitate meaningful Public-Private-People Partnerships (PPPPs)
      that bring together government, civil society, faith-based institutions,
      and the private sector. These inclusive partnerships can co-design and
      implement sustainable solutions in areas such as education, health,
      environment, and livelihoods. By encouraging participatory approaches,
      CSL helps promote accountability, local ownership, and long-term impact
      in development efforts.<br /><br />

      <strong>Catalyzing Inclusive and Ethical Recovery</strong><br /><br />
      As Sri Lanka undertakes critical structural reforms, Caritas Sri Lanka
      (CSL), a responsible and respected faith-based development organization,
      is well-positioned to play a key role in advancing the national agenda.
      With a well-articulated vision and mission rooted in Catholic Social
      Teaching and a longstanding community presence, CSL helps ensure the
      recovery process is inclusive and ethically grounded. Guided by justice,
      dignity, and solidarity, its people-centered strategic framework
      supports economic stability, social cohesion, resilience, and inclusion.
      By aligning its thematic priorities with both national development goals
      and international frameworks such as those of the IMF, CSL positions
      itself as a strategic partner in building a recovery that is not only
      economically viable but also socially just, inclusive, and
      human-centered.<br /><br />

      <i>Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Framework: Caritas Sri
        Lanka – Strategic Plan 2026–2030</i><br /><br />
      The Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) framework ensures that
      Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL) remains accountable to communities, donors, and
      partners while practising a culture of adaptive learning, evidence-based
      planning, and continuous improvement. This framework is structured to
      capture progress across CSL’s strategic thematic areas while emphasizing
      participatory approaches and contextual responsiveness.<br /><br />

        <b>Conclusion</b>
        <br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka’s strategic plan is a comprehensive and
        mission-driven framework rooted in Catholic Social Teaching, aligned
        with its Vision and Mission, and responsive to national economic
        recovery efforts. Integrating the Sustainable Development Goals, it
        reflects the Gospel’s call to love, serve, and seek justice. More than
        operational, the plan is theological—emphasizing love as a
        transformative force. CSL positions itself as a collaborative,
        prophetic actor, committed to humanizing, healing, and transforming
        communities. In a post-war, economically challenged context, CSL
        ensures no one is left behind, embodying the Church’s mission to be a
        faith-based agent of change and hope.
        <br /><br />
        The foundational integration of Catholic Social Teaching is evident
        across all aspects of CSL’s strategic plan. Drawing from encyclicals
        such as <i>Rerum Novarum, Deus Caritas Est, Fratelli Tutti,</i> and
        <i>Laudato Si’</i>the plan prioritizes human dignity, the preferential
        option for the poor, solidarity, and stewardship of creation. The four
        strategic pillars—Integral Human Development, Charity, Empowerment,
        and Peace translate CST into action. These are not abstract values but
        guiding principles for rights-based, community-oriented, and
        spiritually grounded programming. <br /><br />
        Caritas Sri Lanka’s (CSL) strategic plan reflects its vision of a
        “just and harmonious Sri Lankan society driven by Gospel values,” with
        a strong focus on inclusion, equity, and transformation. Grounded in
        Catholic Social Teaching, it empowers marginalized communities—such as
        war-affected families, women-headed households, and persons with
        disabilities—through grassroots engagement, embodying the Gospel call
        to serve the vulnerable.
        <br /><br />
        The plan aligns closely with the United Nations Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs), addressing key areas such as Quality
        Education (SDG 4), Livelihoods (SDGs 1 & 8), Health (SDG 3), Climate
        Action (SDG 13), and Peacebuilding (SDG 16). By contextualizing global
        goals within its faith-based mission, CSL bridges local impact with
        broader development frameworks.
        <br /><br />
        Although CSL is neither a political entity nor a direct recipient of
        IMF support, its strategic plan aligns closely with Sri Lanka’s
        national economic restructuring priorities, including fiscal
        responsibility, targeted social protection, and inclusive development.
        By offering scholarships, community health services, and livelihood
        assistance, CSL helps to bridge essential service gaps created by
        budget reductions. These efforts are especially vital for vulnerable
        populations in rural and post-conflict regions. This localized,
        needs-based response reflects the Catholic Social Teaching principle
        of subsidiarity—empowering communities at the grassroots while
        contributing to broader national progress.
        <br /><br />
        CSL addresses safe migration, disaster preparedness, and climate
        resilience, contributing to long-term stability and sustainable
        development. Its reintegration and environmental programs support both
        family welfare and national resilience strategies. Through
        multi-stakeholder collaboration and public-private-people partnerships
        (PPPPs), CSL fosters shared responsibility and inclusive dialogue.
        This approach reflects Pope Francis’ synodal call to unity,
        discernment, and listening, positioning CSL as a transformative and
        credible civil society partner in Sri Lanka’s development journey.
        <br /><br />
        In conclusion, CSL’s strategic plan is a model of integrated,
        values-driven planning. It effectively unites CST, Gospel-centered
        mission, global development goals, and national priorities into a
        unified approach that prioritizes dignity, justice, and
        sustainability. As Sri Lanka undergoes economic restructuring, CSL
        stands as a prophetic witness—ensuring that recovery is not only
        economically sound but ethically grounded and socially inclusive. The
        strategic plan document is not only a guide for organizational
        programming but also a theologically rooted, socially responsive, and
        ethically grounded roadmap for transformative change in Sri Lankan
        Society.

                  <li>
                    Government policies on NGOs: Changes in government
                    policies could affect the organization's ability to
                    operate or access support.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    National regulatory changes: Shifts in national laws or
                    regulations could introduce new challenges for the
                    organization’s activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Political disruptions/interference: Political instability
                    or interference may hinder program execution or create
                    obstacles in operations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Geopolitics: International geopolitical factors may affect
                    funding, partnerships, and the organization’s ability to
                    operate globally.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some government acts and decisions: Specific actions or
                    policies from the government could disrupt organizational
                    operations or limit its scope of activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    New donor policies: Changes in donor policies could affect
                    funding or shift priorities away from the organization's
                    needs.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Economic Factors:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Economic instability of the country: General economic
                    instability can reduce available funding and resources for
                    development programs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Inflation: Rising inflation may increase operational
                    costs, making it harder to implement programs effectively.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Economic crisis & exchange rates: Economic downturns and
                    volatile exchange rates can have a negative impact on
                    funding and international operations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Donor fatigue due to the global crisis: A decrease in
                    donor support due to the broader global economic or social
                    crises could limit funding opportunities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Competition for donor funding: Increased competition among
                    organizations for limited donor funding can make securing
                    resources more difficult.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lack of funding for priority areas: Limited donor interest
                    or support in critical areas could hinder the
                    organization’s ability to focus on essential initiatives.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Social & Cultural:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Misconception of conversions: There may be public
                    misunderstandings or suspicion about the organization's
                    religious affiliation, potentially hindering its
                    credibility and support.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Suspicion on social work carried out by CSL:
                    Misunderstandings or mistrust of the social work performed
                    by the organization could undermine public support and
                    stakeholder relationships.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Religious extremism: Religious intolerance or extremism
                    could create social tensions or pose threats to the
                    organization’s work, especially in sensitive areas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Dependency mentality: Communities or stakeholders may
                    develop a dependency mentality, reducing their willingness
                    to engage in self-sufficiency or contribute to
                    initiatives.
