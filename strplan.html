            <b><I>Rooted in the Gospel, Committed to the Poor, Called to Transform</I></b>
            <br /><br />
            At the heart of the Church's mission is the call to love, not as sentiment, but as a powerful, transformative force that upholds the dignity of every human being, especially the poor, marginalized, and vulnerable. This love, rooted in faith and action, drives the Church's commitment to justice and compassion.As Pop Benedict XVI affirms in <I>Deus Caritas Est,</I> "Love-Caritas-will always prove necessary, even in the most just society"(DCE,§28). It is this enduring call that inspires and shapes the mission and work of Caritas Sri Lanka.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Purpose and Scope of the Strategic Plan (2026-2030)</b>
            <br /><br />
            Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), the social arm of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Sri Lanka, reaffirms its mission through this Strategic Plan (2026-2030), rooted in Catholic Social Teaching and responsive to the country's socio-economic, political, and environmental realities. Guided by Gospel values, the plan defines CSL's strategic direction as a faith-based actor committed to justice, compassion, and human dignity.
            <br /><br />
            The plan outlines key thematic priorities and goals across sectors including education, livehoods, healtth, environment, disaster risk reduction, peacebuilding, and migration. It ensures alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), national development strategies, and the ongoing economic restructuring agenda. Covering both dioceasan and national levels, the plan provides a unifieed framework for effective implemntation, monitoring, and learning-enabling CSL to adopt to emerging challenges while continuing to serve the most vulnereable communities with relevance and impact. 
            <br /><br />
            This strategic plan offers a renwed vision for CSL, inspired by the theological insights of <I>Deus Caritas Est, Caritas in Veritate, Rerum Novarum, Laudato Si', Fratelli Tutti,</I> and the <I>spirit of Synodality.</I> These documents together form the backbone of the Church's social doctrine provide a profound framework to address today's interrelated crisis: poverty, inequality, environemnt degradation, displacement, and cultural fragmentation.
            <br /><br />
            <b>1. Theological and Social Foundations: Love, Truth, and Justice</b>
            <br /><br />
            The Church's social teaching, being with <I>Rerum Novarum</I>(1891), establishes that the condition of the working classes and the rights of the poor are central to the Gospel mandate.Pope Leo XIII writes, "Every program of actionshould be concerned above all with the well-being of the workers" (RN,§31).CSL's work with plantation communities, war-affected families, and economically marginalized groups echoes this call, focusing on advocacy and rights promotion, especially in regions long neglected by mainstream development.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Caritas in Veritate</i>(2009) by Pope Benedict XVI affirms that charity must be grounded in truth and justice: "Charity is at the heart of the Church's social doctrine" (CiV,§2). It is not enough to respond to symptoms of poverty; struuctural injustice must be transformed. CSL's focus on organizational capacity building and sustainable developemnt represents a deliberate effort to move from short-term relief to long-term empowerment, building systems and communities capable of advocating for their own rights and well-being.
            <br /><br />
            From the theological foundation of love (agape), CSL’s work is not merely functional — it is spiritual. In the Sri Lankan context, where communities carry deep wounds from civil conflict, ethnic division, and economic hardship, love becomes a healing force. As Fratelli Tutti (2020) powerfully states: “Love shatters the chains that keep us isolated and separate; in their place, it builds bridges” (FT, §62). CSL’s peace and reconciliation programs seek precisely to build such bridges — between communities, ethnic groups, and religious traditions — offering healing and promoting a culture of encounter.
            <br /><br />
            <b>2. A Synodal Approach: Journeying Together in Mission</b>
            <br /><br />
            In the current ecclesial context, the Synod on Synodality invites the Church to walk together listening, discerning, and acting as one body. CSL’s strategic planning process embraces this spirit. The plan was shaped through dialogue with diocesan Caritas partners, local communities, Church leaders, and civil society actors, ensuring that it reflects both the voice of the poor and the guidance of the Spirit
            <br /><br />
            Synodality is not a method; it is a way of being Church. As Pope Francis explains, “A synodal Church is a Church of listening” (Synod Preparatory Document, 2021). CSL remains committed to localization empowering diocesan Caritas units and community-based organizations to lead in planning, implementation, and monitoring. This decentralized approach ensures contextual relevance and ownership while remaining united in mission.
            <br /><br />
            <b>3. Strategic Pillars: Grounded in Gospel Values and Local Realities</b>
            <br /><br />
            Rooted in the rich theological foundation shaped by Catholic Social Teaching and Deus Caritas Est, and guided by the practical mission of Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), four finely tuned Key Strategic Pillars have emerged. Each pillar is articulated through powerful expressions, accompanied by a clear Inspiration, Strategic Focus, and Key Actions.
            <br /><br />
            <b>3.1.Integral Human Development</b>
            <br /><br />
            Integral Human Development, grounded in Catholic Social Teaching, promotes the full dignity of every person by addressing injustice, advancing human rights, and fostering inclusion, especially for the poor and marginalized.

            <b>Conclusion: A Gospel-Inspired Path Toward Justice and Sustainability</b>
            <br/><br/>
            This strategic plan is more than a blueprint for action. It is a statement of faith in action, a concrete expression of the Gospel in a wounded yet hopeful Sri Lankan society. Grounded in Catholic Social Teaching, enriched by global Caritas networks, and shaped by the voices of the poor, it calls us to serve with love, advocate with courage, and build communities where every person can flourish as the image of God.
            <br/><br/>
            Caritas Sri Lanka envisions a nation where dignity is upheld, charity is lived, empowerment is realized, peace is cultivated, and resilience is built — a vision that reflects not only the heart of the Church, but the heart of Christ Himself.
            <br/><br/>
            “Everything is connected, and that genuine care for our own lives and our relationships with nature is inseparable from fraternity, justice and faithfulness to others.” <I>— Laudato Si’, §70.</I>

          <h1>Guiding Principles</h1>
          <p class="caritas-text">
            Our work is inspired and grounded in the values of Catholic Social Teaching, which uphold the dignity of every human being and the call to act with justice, compassion, and love.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Dignity of the Human Person</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We affirm the inherent dignity and equality of every human life, from conception to natural death. We unequivocally reject the marginalization of the poor, persons with disabilities, the elderly, or any vulnerable members of the human family.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Mercy and Compassion</b>
            <br/><br/>
            Rooted in the Gospel, mercy and compassion guide our mission. We are called to respond to suffering with love and action, walking alongside those in pain to restore hope and dignity.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Formation of the Heart</b>
            <br/><br/>
            Charity is not only a professional duty but a vocation of love. Those who serve in our mission are called to a “formation of the heart,” dedicating themselves to others with deep empathy and a genuine commitment to human dignity. This formation complements and enriches professional training.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Equal Opportunities and Responsibilities</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We promote the equal dignity, rights, and responsibilities of women and men, advocating for inclusive participation and shared leadership in every aspect of society.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Preferential Option for the Poor</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We prioritize the needs of those who are poor, marginalized, or vulnerable. In solidarity with them, we work to challenge the root causes of poverty and injustice, helping to build a more equitable and compassionate world.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Universal Destination of the Goods of the Earth</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We believe that the earth and its resources are meant for the benefit of all. We strive to transform unjust systems and structures so that everyone can share in the fruits of creation and enjoy their basic human rights.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Solidarity</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We embrace the interconnectedness of the human family. By standing with the poor and advocating for the common good, we commit to building a more just and united world.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Subsidiarity and Cooperation</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We uphold the principle of subsidiarity, respecting the autonomy of local communities while fostering cooperation across our global network. A united approach enables us to be more effective in advancing our shared mission.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Stewardship of Creation</b>
            <br/><br/>
            The earth is a sacred trust, given for the benefit of all. As stewards of creation, we are committed to promoting sustainable practices and inspiring care for our common home, ensuring it remains a life-giving gift for generations to come.

          <h1>Consolidated and elaborated SWOT Analysis:</h1>
          <p class="caritas-text">
            Caritas Sri Lanka’s distinctiveness anchored in its Catholic identity, Gospel mission, and Church mandate is not just symbolic but strategic. This uniqueness fosters deep-rooted trust, credibility, and community presence, enabling CSL to effectively navigate weaknesses such as limited visibility, resource dependency, and staff turnover. Amid growing external threats like political instability, religious intolerance, and funding volatility, CSL’s strengths mainly its ecclesial structure, interfaith engagement, and grassroots networks combined with emerging opportunities in youth engagement, digital tools, and strategic partnerships, empower it to sustain impact, uphold dignity, and transform vulnerable communities with resilience and faith-driven integrity.
