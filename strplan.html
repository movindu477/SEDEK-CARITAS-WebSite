          <br /><br />
          At the heart of the Church's mission is the call to love, not as
          sentiment, but as a powerful, transformative force that upholds the
          dignity of every human being, especially the poor, marginalized, and
          vulnerable. This love, rooted in faith and action, drives the Church's
          commitment to justice and compassion.As Pop Benedict XVI affirms in
          <i>Deus Caritas Est,</i> "Love-Caritas-will always prove necessary,
          even in the most just society"(DCE,§28). It is this enduring call that
          inspires and shapes the mission and work of Caritas Sri Lanka.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Purpose and Scope of the Strategic Plan (2026-2030)</b>
          <br /><br />
          Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), the social arm of the Catholic Bishops'
          Conference of Sri Lanka, reaffirms its mission through this Strategic
          Plan (2026-2030), rooted in Catholic Social Teaching and responsive to
          the country's socio-economic, political, and environmental realities.
          Guided by Gospel values, the plan defines CSL's strategic direction as
          a faith-based actor committed to justice, compassion, and human
          dignity.
          <br /><br />
          The plan outlines key thematic priorities and goals across sectors
          including education, livehoods, healtth, environment, disaster risk
          reduction, peacebuilding, and migration. It ensures alignment with the
          Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), national development strategies,
          and the ongoing economic restructuring agenda. Covering both dioceasan
          and national levels, the plan provides a unifieed framework for
          effective implemntation, monitoring, and learning-enabling CSL to
          adopt to emerging challenges while continuing to serve the most
          vulnereable communities with relevance and impact.
          <br /><br />
          This strategic plan offers a renwed vision for CSL, inspired by the
          theological insights of
          <i
            >Deus Caritas Est, Caritas in Veritate, Rerum Novarum, Laudato Si',
            Fratelli Tutti,</i
          >
          and the <i>spirit of Synodality.</i> These documents together form the
          backbone of the Church's social doctrine provide a profound framework
          to address today's interrelated crisis: poverty, inequality,
          environemnt degradation, displacement, and cultural fragmentation.
          <br /><br />
          <b>1. Theological and Social Foundations: Love, Truth, and Justice</b>
          <br /><br />
          The Church's social teaching, being with <i>Rerum Novarum</i>(1891),
          establishes that the condition of the working classes and the rights
          of the poor are central to the Gospel mandate.Pope Leo XIII writes,
          "Every program of actionshould be concerned above all with the
          well-being of the workers" (RN,§31).CSL's work with plantation
          communities, war-affected families, and economically marginalized
          groups echoes this call, focusing on advocacy and rights promotion,
          especially in regions long neglected by mainstream development.
          <br /><br />
          <i>Caritas in Veritate</i>(2009) by Pope Benedict XVI affirms that
          charity must be grounded in truth and justice: "Charity is at the
          heart of the Church's social doctrine" (CiV,§2). It is not enough to
          respond to symptoms of poverty; struuctural injustice must be
          transformed. CSL's focus on organizational capacity building and
          sustainable developemnt represents a deliberate effort to move from
          short-term relief to long-term empowerment, building systems and
          communities capable of advocating for their own rights and well-being.
          <br /><br />
          From the theological foundation of love (agape), CSL’s work is not
          merely functional — it is spiritual. In the Sri Lankan context, where
          communities carry deep wounds from civil conflict, ethnic division,
          and economic hardship, love becomes a healing force. As Fratelli Tutti
          (2020) powerfully states: “Love shatters the chains that keep us
          isolated and separate; in their place, it builds bridges” (FT, §62).
          CSL’s peace and reconciliation programs seek precisely to build such
          bridges — between communities, ethnic groups, and religious traditions
          — offering healing and promoting a culture of encounter.
          <br /><br />
          <b>2. A Synodal Approach: Journeying Together in Mission</b>
          <br /><br />
          In the current ecclesial context, the Synod on Synodality invites the
          Church to walk together listening, discerning, and acting as one body.
          CSL’s strategic planning process embraces this spirit. The plan was
          shaped through dialogue with diocesan Caritas partners, local
          communities, Church leaders, and civil society actors, ensuring that
          it reflects both the voice of the poor and the guidance of the Spirit
          <br /><br />
          Synodality is not a method; it is a way of being Church. As Pope
          Francis explains, “A synodal Church is a Church of listening” (Synod
          Preparatory Document, 2021). CSL remains committed to localization
          empowering diocesan Caritas units and community-based organizations to
          lead in planning, implementation, and monitoring. This decentralized
          approach ensures contextual relevance and ownership while remaining
          united in mission.
          <br /><br />
          <b
            >3. Strategic Pillars: Grounded in Gospel Values and Local
            Realities</b
          >
          <br /><br />
          Rooted in the rich theological foundation shaped by Catholic Social
          Teaching and Deus Caritas Est, and guided by the practical mission of
          Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL), four finely tuned Key Strategic Pillars have
          emerged. Each pillar is articulated through powerful expressions,
          accompanied by a clear Inspiration, Strategic Focus, and Key Actions.
          <br /><br />

          poor and marginalized.

          >
          <br /><br />
          This strategic plan is more than a blueprint for action. It is a
          statement of faith in action, a concrete expression of the Gospel in a
          wounded yet hopeful Sri Lankan society. Grounded in Catholic Social
          Teaching, enriched by global Caritas networks, and shaped by the
          voices of the poor, it calls us to serve with love, advocate with
          courage, and build communities where every person can flourish as the
          image of God.
          <br /><br />
          Caritas Sri Lanka envisions a nation where dignity is upheld, charity
          is lived, empowerment is realized, peace is cultivated, and resilience
          is built — a vision that reflects not only the heart of the Church,
          but the heart of Christ Himself.
          <br /><br />
          “Everything is connected, and that genuine care for our own lives and
          our relationships with nature is inseparable from fraternity, justice
          and faithfulness to others.” <i>— Laudato Si’, §70.</i>

        <h1>Guiding Principles</h1>
        <p class="caritas-text">
          Our work is inspired and grounded in the values of Catholic Social
          Teaching, which uphold the dignity of every human being and the call
          to act with justice, compassion, and love.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Dignity of the Human Person</b>
          <br /><br />
          We affirm the inherent dignity and equality of every human life, from
          conception to natural death. We unequivocally reject the
          marginalization of the poor, persons with disabilities, the elderly,
          or any vulnerable members of the human family.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Mercy and Compassion</b>
          <br /><br />
          Rooted in the Gospel, mercy and compassion guide our mission. We are
          called to respond to suffering with love and action, walking alongside
          those in pain to restore hope and dignity.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Formation of the Heart</b>
          <br /><br />
          Charity is not only a professional duty but a vocation of love. Those
          who serve in our mission are called to a “formation of the heart,”
          dedicating themselves to others with deep empathy and a genuine
          commitment to human dignity. This formation complements and enriches
          professional training.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Equal Opportunities and Responsibilities</b>
          <br /><br />
          We promote the equal dignity, rights, and responsibilities of women
          and men, advocating for inclusive participation and shared leadership
          in every aspect of society.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Preferential Option for the Poor</b>
          <br /><br />
          We prioritize the needs of those who are poor, marginalized, or
          vulnerable. In solidarity with them, we work to challenge the root
          causes of poverty and injustice, helping to build a more equitable and
          compassionate world.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Universal Destination of the Goods of the Earth</b>
          <br /><br />
          We believe that the earth and its resources are meant for the benefit
          of all. We strive to transform unjust systems and structures so that
          everyone can share in the fruits of creation and enjoy their basic
          human rights.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Solidarity</b>
          <br /><br />
          We embrace the interconnectedness of the human family. By standing
          with the poor and advocating for the common good, we commit to
          building a more just and united world.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Subsidiarity and Cooperation</b>
          <br /><br />
          We uphold the principle of subsidiarity, respecting the autonomy of
          local communities while fostering cooperation across our global
          network. A united approach enables us to be more effective in
          advancing our shared mission.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Stewardship of Creation</b>
          <br /><br />
          The earth is a sacred trust, given for the benefit of all. As stewards
          of creation, we are committed to promoting sustainable practices and
          inspiring care for our common home, ensuring it remains a life-giving
          gift for generations to come.

          <br /><br />
          The "Enhancing Resilience" program by CSL in Sri Lanka has provided
          vital support to those affected by the prolonged economic crisis. It

          children with educational facilities, counseled 552 individuals,
          provided medical treatment to 4,709 chronically ill patients, offered
          psychosocial support to 1,250 individuals, and aided 9,750 people in

          <br /><br />
          <b>Religious Amity</b>
          <br /><br />
          CSL has played a pivotal role in fostering a common vision of
          tolerance and harmony among all religions in Sri Lanka through
          initiatives aimed at changing public attitudes towards religious
          harmony for peacebuilding.CSL's exemplary approach to Religious Amity
          has garnered recognition, serving as a model for organizations and
          countries facing similar contexts. Sharing experiences with diverse
          groups like UNFPA, Agiamondo, and the University of Peradeniya,
          Caritas has fostered unity and dialogue.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Safe Migration</b>
          <br /><br />
          Caritas Sri Lanka supports migrants at every stage—aspiring,
          in-service, and returnees—through legal aid, case management, and
          compensation facilitation. It addresses issues like contract
          violations, trafficking, and unpaid wages. Caritas also provides
          psychosocial support to migrant families and conducts awareness
          sessions on safe, legal migration. By collaborating with the Catholic
          Migration Commission, government bodies, and stakeholders, Caritas
          ensures rights protection and promotes informed migration practices
          for vulnerable communities across Sri Lanka.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Environment protection </b>
          <br /><br />
          CSL’s proactive engagement with stakeholders and communities through
          initiatives like the 'Stepping Stone to Safeguarding Sri Lanka's
          Natural Environment Project' demonstrates a commitment to
          environmental awareness and action, as seen in their extensive
          clean-up, solidarity, and tree planting campaigns. Through
          collaboration and media outreach, Caritas continues to champion
          environmental conservation and climate justice, setting a noteworthy
          precedent for sustainable development.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Promoting Justice and Peace</b>
          <br /><br />
          As the National Secretariat of the Justice, Peace, and Human
          Development Commission of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference, Caritas
          Sri Lanka plays a vital advocacy and educational role. It conducts
          awareness programs, study sessions, and campaigns on critical national
          issues such as elections, the 13th Amendment, the Anti-Terrorism Act,
          human rights, and social justice. Through these efforts, Caritas
          fosters democratic values, informed civic participation, and dialogue,
          promoting peace, justice, and human dignity across communities in Sri
          Lanka.
          <br /><br />
          <b>A Learning and Proactive Organisation</b>
          <br /><br />
          Caritas Sri Lanka demonstrated its proactive and learning-oriented
          approach through its comprehensive response to the Easter Sunday
          attacks ( 21st April, 2019) offering psychosocial care, medical aid,
          financial and educational support, and interfaith healing.
          Simultaneously, it engaged in evidence-based advocacy, publishing
          research on plantation community welfare, migration challenges, and
          interreligious peacebuilding. By documenting lived realities and
          informing policy through data-driven insights, including the Sri Lanka
          country profile, Caritas advances sustainable development, social
          justice, and resilience-building across diverse and vulnerable
          communities.

        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />

        <h1>Consolidated and elaborated SWOT Analysis:</h1>
        <p class="caritas-text">
          Caritas Sri Lanka’s distinctiveness anchored in its Catholic identity,
          Gospel mission, and Church mandate is not just symbolic but strategic.
          This uniqueness fosters deep-rooted trust, credibility, and community
          presence, enabling CSL to effectively navigate weaknesses such as
          limited visibility, resource dependency, and staff turnover. Amid
          growing external threats like political instability, religious
          intolerance, and funding volatility, CSL’s strengths mainly its
          ecclesial structure, interfaith engagement, and grassroots networks
          combined with emerging opportunities in youth engagement, digital
          tools, and strategic partnerships, empower it to sustain impact,
          uphold dignity, and transform vulnerable communities with resilience
          and faith-driven integrity.

          Caritas Sri Lanka (CSL) is committed to addressing the deep-rooted and
          evolving challenges in post-war Northern and Eastern regions, where
          trauma, youth unemployment, malnutrition, and weak governance persist.
          Similarly, plantation workers, fishing communities, and agricultural
          labourers continue to struggle with poverty, poor living conditions,
          lack of education, and limited livelihood opportunities. CSL
          recognizes that inclusive, locally contextualised and rights-based
          interventions are essential to building resilience, restoring dignity,
          and promoting sustainable peace and development across all
          marginalized and vulnerable communities in Sri Lanka.

          <b>Sri Lanka: Country Context and Regional Disparities</b>
          <br /><br />
          Sri Lanka, a strategically located island nation in South Asia, lies
          just south of India in the Indian Ocean. Commonly referred to as the
          "Pearl of the Indian Ocean," it is celebrated for its rich cultural
          heritage, ecological diversity, and resilient population. With a
          population of approximately 22 million, the country is home to three
          major ethnic groups Sinhalese, Tamils, and Moors and functions as a
          Democratic Socialist Republic. Colombo serves as the commercial
          capital, while Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is the administrative
          capital. The country has made significant development strides,
          especially following the end of a 30-year civil conflict in 2009.
          However, despite its progress, Sri Lanka faces acute socio-economic,
          political, and environmental challenges.
          <br /><br />
          Economically, the country relies heavily on services (nearly 60% of
          GDP), along with key sectors such as apparel, tourism, and
          agriculture. In 2022, Sri Lanka faced a historic economic collapse
          driven by foreign exchange shortages, soaring inflation, and debt
          default. Though a partial recovery began in 2023–2024, regional
          inequalities remain a significant barrier to inclusive growth.
          <br /><br />
          National-level indicators such as a 2023 Human Development Index (HDI)
          of 0.776 mask deep regional disparities. The Western Province, which
          includes Colombo, dominates economic output, contributing around 43.7%
          of GDP, with high HDI levels exceeding 0.80. It benefits from advanced
          infrastructure, ICT access, and employment opportunities, but also
          faces challenges such as urban poverty, congestion, and environmental
          stress.
          <br /><br />
          In contrast, the Plantation Region—home to a large Indian Tamil estate
          worker population—suffers chronic underdevelopment. Districts such as
          Nuwara Eliya and Badulla report HDI levels below 0.70, with widespread
          poverty, educational dropouts, and limited access to services. The
          Northern and Eastern Provinces, which were heavily affected by the
          civil war, continue to experience post-conflict challenges, including
          land disputes, unemployment, and weak institutional support.
          <br /><br />
          Addressing these disparities is vital for Sri Lanka’s long-term
          stability and development. A national strategy that integrates
          regional needs especially in conflict-affected, rural, and estate
          sectors—is essential to ensure equitable and sustainable progress for
          all Sri Lankans.

        <b>Sri Lanka HDI Analysis – 2024 </b>
        <br /><br />

        <p class="caritas-text">
          In 2024, Sri Lanka retained its "high human development" status with
          an HDI score of 0.776, ranking 89th out of 193 countries, the highest
          in South Asia. Key strengths include life expectancy (75.9 years),
          high literacy (92%), mean years of schooling (10.8), and universal
          healthcare and education access, showcasing institutional resilience
          amid economic crises.
          <br /><br />
          However, the inequality-adjusted HDI drops by 18%, revealing sharp
          disparities. The richest 1% control 20.5% of income, while the bottom
          40% hold just 19%. Female labor force participation remains low (33%),
          despite strong educational parity. The Gender Development Index
          reflects a gap—male HDI: 0.795; female HDI: 0.755.
          <br /><br />
          GNI per capita (PPP) declined to below $11,500, while poverty surged
          to 24% post-2022 crisis. Real wages fell by up to 22%, and food
          insecurity affects 5 million people. An aging population (8.1% over
          65) and climate vulnerability (floods displacing 6,000 in 2024) add
          pressure to public systems. Digital inequality persists in rural,
          estate, and post-war regions, limiting access to digital services and
          opportunities.
          <br /><br />
          Addressing economic inequality, gender gaps, aging, climate
          resilience, and digital inclusion is critical to sustain and advance
          human development in Sri Lanka

          Sri Lanka
        </b>
        <br /><br />
        Social and Psychological Impact
        <br /><br />

        <p class="caritas-text">
          The decades-long civil war (1983–2009) caused widespread displacement,
          loss of life, and the breakdown of family and community structures
          across the Northern and Eastern provinces, particularly in Mannar,
          Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vanni, and Batticaloa. More than 89,000 women
          were widowed, and countless children were orphaned or left with a
          single parent. Many women-headed households face severe socio-economic
          vulnerabilities and trauma. Post-conflict trauma remains largely
          unaddressed, with no systemic counselling support for war-affected
          individuals. The psychological effects—especially among youth born
          during the war—manifest in rising rates of suicide, substance abuse,
          family violence, and anti-social behaviour, weakening overall
          community cohesion.
          <br /><br />
          Economic Challenges
          <br /><br />
          Post-war economic recovery has been slow and uneven. Livelihoods
          centered on agriculture and fisheries remain underdeveloped due to
          damaged infrastructure, climate impacts, and lack of investment.
          Farmers face difficulties accessing irrigation and quality inputs,
          while fishing communities struggle with illegal fishing practices,
          destroyed mangroves, and unregulated aquaculture projects such as
          prawn and sea cucumber farms. Income insecurity is widespread,
          especially among women-headed households who often pawn assets to meet
          basic needs. Youth unemployment is high, pushing many into unsafe
          migration, drug use, or informal sectors. Micro-enterprises lack
          credit access and market linkages, while opportunities for value
          addition and collective production remain underutilized.
          <br /><br />
          Governance and Institutional Gaps
          <br /><br />
          Weak institutional capacity continues to hinder post-war recovery.
          Civil society organizations (CBOs) are under-resourced and lack the
          ability to influence policy or facilitate community development. Local
          governance structures often fail to deliver basic services such as
          healthcare, housing, water, and transport—especially in newly
          resettled and remote areas. Land disputes, unresolved cases of missing
          persons, and the continued detention of political prisoners have
          eroded trust in political processes. Disillusionment with traditional
          political parties has led to growing support for reform-oriented
          movements that emphasize accountability, justice, and inclusive
          development.
          <br /><br />
          Cultural and Inter-Communal Tensions
          <br /><br />
          Despite official narratives of peace, ethnic and religious divisions
          continue to undermine reconciliation. The post-war period saw renewed
          tensions between Tamil, Muslim, Sinhalese, and Christian communities,
          particularly after incidents like the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks in
          Batticaloa. Religious sites have become flashpoints for conflict,
          often exacerbated by political manipulation and lack of interfaith
          engagement. Cultural erosion, stigmatization of widows and
          ex-combatants, and lack of culturally grounded reconciliation
          processes further deepen divides and threaten long-term social
          harmony.
          <br /><br />
          Environmental and Disaster Vulnerability
          <br /><br />
          Environmental degradation poses a growing threat to sustainable
          development in the region. Climate change has led to erratic rainfall,
          frequent droughts, and flash floods that disrupt agriculture, displace
          communities, and destroy infrastructure. In Mannar Island, large-scale
          wind power and mineral sand mining projects are threatening
          biodiversity, ecosystems, and traditional livelihoods. The Vankalai
          Sanctuary, a critical site for migratory birds, is under threat due to
          poorly managed development, with limited environmental safeguards in
          place.
          <br /><br />
          Education and Youth Development
          <br /><br />
          Education remains a key challenge in post-war recovery. War
          disruptions, poverty, and trauma have led to high dropout rates,
          especially among youth. The current economic crisis has further forced
          many children out of school, particularly in rural areas. Schools
          suffer from poor infrastructure, understaffing, and lack of
          psychosocial support. Many youth lack skills and access to higher
          education or vocational training, limiting their employment
          opportunities and fueling frustration, migration, and social unrest.
          Investment in education is critical to break the cycle of poverty and
          rebuild war-affected communities.

        <p class="caritas-text">
          In his official visit to Sri Lanka from 26 November to 3 December
          2021, Mr. Tomoya Obokata, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on
          contemporary forms of slavery, revealed persistent structural and
          systemic inequalities affecting the Malaiyaha Tamil community. Brought
          from India over two centuries ago to work on British-run plantations,
          this community continues to face widespread discrimination,
          exploitative labour practices, and social exclusion. The Rapporteur’s
          findings highlight the urgent need for structural reforms and
          inclusive development.
        </p>

        <b>Labour Exploitation and Inhumane Living Conditions</b>

        <p class="caritas-text">
          Malaiyaha Tamils remain highly vulnerable to contemporary forms of
          slavery, especially in smaller private plantations where bonded labour
          persists. Workers are often unable to leave due to debts owed to
          estate owners. Although wages were officially increased to LKR 1,000
          per day in 2021, this gain was undermined by management practices such
          as increasing daily output targets and applying arbitrary wage
          deductions. These practices contribute to conditions that amount to
          forced labour and, in some cases, serfdom.
          <br /><br />
          Housing conditions further entrench this exploitation. The community
          continues to live in colonial-era line houses, often without land
          ownership rights. These structures—typically 10 x 12 feet—house 5 to
          10 individuals and lack basic infrastructure like windows, kitchens,
          running water, and electricity. Families often share communal
          latrines. Despite numerous requests to estate management, improvements
          remain minimal, and civil society organizations attempting to assist
          the community have reportedly faced harassment and surveillance.
          <br /><br />
        </p>

        <b>Limited Access to Services and Systemic Discrimination</b>

        <p class="caritas-text">
          <br /><br />
          Healthcare access within plantations is critically inadequate. Many
          dispensaries are staffed by unqualified personnel, and no nearby
          hospitals exist, making emergency care both inaccessible and
          unaffordable. Government social welfare programs are reportedly
          implemented in name but seldom reach plantation communities.
          <br /><br />
          Although some housing projects—including those supported by the Indian
          government—have been initiated, affordability is a major concern.
          Workers may be forced to take out large loans to access better
          housing, perpetuating cycles of debt and economic vulnerability.
          <br /><br />
          A major barrier to justice and public service access is language
          discrimination. While both Tamil and Sinhala are official languages,
          many public officials use only Sinhala, making it difficult for
          Tamil-speaking workers to report abuses or access legal remedies. This
          linguistic divide also contributes to broader inequality in access to
          education, employment, and state services.
          <br /><br />
        </p>

        <b>Youth, Education, and the Future of the Community</b>

        <p class="caritas-text">
          Many young Malaiyaha Tamils reject plantation work due to its
          exploitative nature, yet decent employment alternatives are scarce.
          Discrimination and limited access to vocational education mean most
          end up in informal sectors such as domestic work, cleaning, retail, or
          even sex work—roles often marked by precariousness and exploitation.
          <br /><br />
          Education, though legally integrated into the national system since
          1975, remains substandard. The literacy rate in plantation sectors is
          just 66%, compared to 92% in urban areas. COVID-19 worsened this gap.
          The shift to online learning left many children behind due to lack of
          internet access and inability to afford smartphones or computers.
          <br /><br />
          The report reveals a deeply entrenched system of ethnically rooted
          inequality and labour exploitation affecting the Malaiyaha Tamil
          community. Addressing these injustices requires not only immediate
          policy reforms but also a commitment to inclusive, rights-based
          development that centers the voices and needs of marginalized groups.

          >Social Context in Sri Lanka: National Overview with Regional
          Disparities</b
        >

        <p class="caritas-text">
          Sri Lanka has made notable progress in human development, particularly
          in education and healthcare. With a national literacy rate of 95.7%
          and life expectancy averaging 76 years, the country performs well on
          many social indicators. These achievements are largely attributed to
          its universal healthcare system and free public education. However,
          beneath this national progress lie deep regional inequalities that
          affect vulnerable groups disproportionately.
          <br /><br />
          Urban centers like <b>Colombo</b> in the Western Province enjoy high
          levels of social development, with widespread access to healthcare,
          education, and digital services. Yet, even in urban areas, growing
          inequality is evident through rising slum populations and social
          exclusion. In Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, youth unemployment,
          caste-based discrimination, and out-migration persist. Anuradhapura
          also grapples with high incidences of chronic kidney disease (CKDu)
          and malnutrition, particularly in rural areas. <br /><br />
          The Plantation Region, especially Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and
          Ratnapura, faces severe socio-economic deficits. Estate workers,
          primarily Indian Tamil communities, live in overcrowded line houses
          with poor sanitation and limited transport access. Educational dropout
          rates are high after primary school due to poverty and cultural
          constraints. Health concerns such as malnutrition, maternal mortality,
          tuberculosis, and HIV remain prevalent.
          <br /><br />
          In the Northern and Eastern Provinces—including Jaffna, Mannar,
          Kilinochchi, Batticaloa, and Trincomalee—the legacy of civil war
          continues to impact social cohesion. Vanni suffers from widespread
          trauma, school dropouts, and drug abuse. Mannar and Batticaloa face
          early marriage, inter-ethnic tensions, and child labor. Access to
          healthcare is inadequate in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, while
          Trincomalee struggles with ethnic segregation in schools.
          <br /><br />
          Gender disparities also compound social challenges. 25% of households
          are female-headed, many due to war widowhood, and districts like
          Ampara report female labor force participation as low as 17.1%. These
          households often lack access to land, income, and social protection.
          <br /><br />
          Sri Lanka’s impressive national averages conceal significant regional
          divides. Addressing these disparities—particularly in estate, rural,
          and post-conflict regions—is essential for ensuring equitable and
          sustainable social development across the country.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Economic Context: National Overview with Regional Disparities</b>
          <br /><br />
          Sri Lanka, a strategically located island in the Indian Ocean, is
          undergoing a fragile yet steady economic recovery following its
          historic collapse in 2022. The crisis driven by foreign exchange
          shortages, unsustainable debt, and poor fiscal governance exposed deep
          structural weaknesses in the economy. In response, the government
          secured a USD 2.9 billion IMF bailout in 2023, followed by a critical
          USD 12.55 billion debt restructuring in late 2024, which restored some
          investor confidence, stabilized the currency, and brought inflation
          under control. By 2025, GDP growth has resumed cautiously, with
          forecasts of 5% growth, although economic vulnerabilities persist.
          <br /><br />
          The economic structure is moderately diversified. The services sector
          contributes around 60% of GDP, led by tourism, ICT, logistics, and
          finance. The industrial sector, contributing 26%, is anchored in
          garments and apparel exports, while agriculture, though reduced to
          7.5–8% of GDP, remains essential for food security and rural
          employment. Remittances and tourism remain critical foreign exchange
          sources, while export-import imbalances and high external debt—USD
          57.2 billion or ~57.8% of GDP—pose ongoing challenges.
          <br /><br />
          According to the labor force survey 2022 data, 49.8% of the
          working-age population (8.5 million) is economically active, with
          approximately 65.3% male and 34.7% female, or around 5.6 million and 3
          million, respectively. The highest number of economically active
          labour is in the Rural sector, which is nearly 76%. The corresponding
          figures for the Urban and Estate sectors are 16% and 5% respectively.
          <br /><br />
          Regional economic disparities sharply shape development outcomes. The
          Western Province, particularly Colombo, contributes over 41–46% of
          national GDP, benefiting from infrastructure such as the Colombo Port,
          Port City, and vibrant startup ecosystems. In contrast, Kurunegala and
          Anuradhapura depend on subsistence agriculture and informal labor,
          with incomes vulnerable to climate shocks and limited industrial
          diversification. Chilaw’s economy revolves around fishing and coconut
          farming, constrained by poor market access and limited technological
          integration.
          <br /><br />
          The Plantation Region remains economically marginalized. Despite being
          central to tea production, workers face low wages, high youth
          unemployment, and limited access to vocational or digital skills.
          Microfinance debt burdens many, especially women, worsening economic
          precarity.
          <br /><br />
          In the Northern and Eastern Provinces economic revival post-conflict
          has been uneven. Agriculture and fisheries dominate, but are undercut
          by illegal fishing, environmental degradation, and weak private
          investment. While Jaffna shows potential in ICT and small-scale
          apparel, centralized economic planning and military control over
          assets hinder growth. Youth unemployment surpasses 30% in several
          districts.
          <br /><br />
          These imbalances directly impact HDI indicators by suppressing income
          levels, limiting access to services, and constraining equitable
          economic participation. Addressing them requires decentralization,
          inclusive planning, and targeted regional investment to ensure
          sustainable, broad-based growth.
          <br /><br />

          >Climate Vulnerability and Agriculture: National and Regional
          Context</b
        >

        <p class="caritas-text">
          Sri Lanka, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, is highly vulnerable
          to climate change due to its geographic location and socio-economic
          dependence on climate-sensitive sectors. Approximately 50% of its 22
          million population resides in low-lying coastal areas, making them
          highly exposed to sea-level rise, storm surges, and salinity
          intrusion. The country frequently experiences extreme weather events,
          including floods, droughts, and landslides, with increasing intensity
          and unpredictability. These shifts pose serious risks to
          infrastructure, biodiversity, and human health, with direct
          repercussions on national development and HDI outcomes.
          <br /><br />
          Agriculture, while contributing only 7.5–8% of GDP, remains a critical
          source of livelihood for a large portion of the rural population.
          However, changing rainfall patterns have disrupted traditional monsoon
          cycles, particularly in the dry and intermediate zones, affecting
          regions like Anuradhapura and Kurunegala, where farmers now struggle
          with irrigation stress and crop failures. Prolonged droughts in the
          North Central Province have increased the incidence of chronic kidney
          disease linked to contaminated water sources. In Chilaw, saltwater
          intrusion and erratic coastal weather further reduce arable land and
          threaten fishing-based livelihoods.
          <br /><br />
          In the Plantation Region, notably Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and
          Ratnapura—the impacts of climate change are felt through rising
          temperatures, landslides, and soil erosion, threatening tea production
          and local settlements. Poor land management, chemical runoff, and
          limited adoption of climate-smart practices exacerbate environmental
          degradation. While some estates have piloted organic farming and
          agroforestry, these remain under-resourced and poorly scaled.
          <br /><br />
          In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, already struggling from the
          legacy of conflict, environmental degradation is acute. Mannar and
          Mullaitivu face severe soil erosion and mine-contaminated lands that
          remain unsuitable for cultivation. In Kilinochchi and Batticaloa,
          water scarcity and deforestation undermine both agriculture and
          community resilience. Trincomalee suffers from illegal fishing,
          coastal degradation, and a loss of mangroves that previously buffered
          climate shocks.
          <br /><br />
          Across all regions, post-harvest losses, pest outbreaks, and market
          inaccessibility remain significant barriers. Without urgent investment
          in climate-resilient agriculture, early warning systems, and
          community-based adaptation, these environmental pressures will
          continue to erode food security, income stability, and public health,
          thus undermining HDI progress in already marginalized areas

        >

        <p class="caritas-text">
          Sri Lanka’s technological landscape is evolving rapidly, particularly
          in the services sector, where ICT and telecommunications contribute
          significantly to the nearly 60% share of GDP. The country has gained
          international recognition for its growing IT and BPM (Business Process
          Management) exports, supported by investments in digital platforms
          across governance, education, and healthcare. Urban centers,
          especially Colombo, benefit from 4G/5G connectivity, smart
          infrastructure projects under the Megapolis plan, and thriving
          fintech, e-governance, and AI ecosystems. These advancements have
          improved administrative efficiency, expanded digital employment, and
          enhanced citizen access to services.
          <br /><br />
          However, Sri Lanka faces a widening digital divide, especially in
          rural, estate, and conflict-affected regions. In districts like
          Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, digital infrastructure remains
          underdeveloped, with inconsistent broadband access in schools and
          homes. Chilaw, with its coastal isolation, suffers from severe digital
          exclusion, impeding access to e-learning and online services. The
          Plantation Region shows the deepest digital marginalization, where
          low-income estate workers lack affordable internet, digital skills,
          and devices, creating barriers to education and livelihoods.
          <br /><br />
          In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, Jaffna has made moderate
          progress through ICT centers and university-led initiatives. Yet,
          districts like Mannar, Mullaitivu, and Batticaloa continue to lag due
          to weak connectivity, language constraints, and low uptake of digital
          training. Though pilot programs in smart agriculture and community ICT
          centres exist, they remain limited in reach and impact.
          <br /><br />
          Technological underdevelopment constrains human capital formation,
          particularly in education and employment. The lack of inclusive access
          to digital tools and training widens regional and income-based
          inequalities, directly affecting HDI components such as knowledge and
          income. Bridging this gap is essential for equitable development and
          long-term resilience in a tech-driven global economy.

          >Political Context: National Overview with Regional Disparities in Sri
          Lanka</b
        >

        <p class="caritas-text">
          <br /><br />
          Sri Lanka’s political environment remains complex and fluid, shaped by
          decades of civil conflict and recent economic crises. The 2022
          economic collapse triggered widespread protests, undermining public
          trust and culminating in a major leadership change highlighting urgent
          efforts to consolidate power and drive reforms amid ongoing governance
          challenges.
          <br /><br />
          Governance in Sri Lanka remains highly centralized, with Colombo as
          the dominant hub for policymaking and resource distribution. This
          centralization facilitates national coordination but deepens regional
          inequalities. The Western Region, especially Colombo, benefits from
          stronger infrastructure, better services, and political influence. In
          contrast, rural and peri-urban areas such as Kurunegala, Anuradhapura,
          and Chilaw face political marginalization and elite capture, limiting
          equitable development despite Chilaw’s location in a relatively
          prosperous province.
          <br /><br />
          Post-conflict Northern and Eastern Provinces continue to experience
          weak local autonomy under centralized control. Districts like
          Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Batticaloa confront slow recovery,
          ongoing militarization, unresolved land disputes, and minimal
          resettlement. Demographic shifts in Mannar and Trincomalee generate
          social tensions, while Jaffna, the Tamil cultural heartland, remains
          politically distanced from Colombo’s power structures. Political
          marginalization is also acute in the Plantation Region, where the
          Indian Tamil community in districts such as Nuwara Eliya and Badulla
          suffers from disconnected representation, inconsistent policies, and
          weak labor unions.
          <br /><br />
          These patterns of centralized governance, elite dominance, and
          regional political exclusion directly hinder equitable resource access
          and service delivery, suppressing human development outcomes across
          Sri Lanka’s diverse regions.
          <br /><br />
        </p>

        <b
          >Legal Context: National Overview with Regional Disparities in Sri
          Lanka</b
        >

        <p class="caritas-text">
          <br /><br />
          Sri Lanka’s legal framework supports key development goals, including
          labor rights, environmental protection, and gender equality, with laws
          such as the 2016 minimum wage and climate adaptation policies.
          However, uneven implementation across rural, estate, and marginalized
          communities limits their impact. The coexistence of civil, personal,
          and customary laws—known as legal pluralism—creates enforcement
          challenges, especially in gender justice. Although legal protections
          against domestic violence and equal marriage age exist, variations in
          application among ethnic and religious groups restrict women’s access
          to justice.
          <br /><br />
          Judicial independence and efficiency remain critical issues
          nationwide. Court backlogs, low legal literacy, and perceived
          political interference undermine timely justice. Environmental and
          land-use laws, though comprehensive on paper, suffer from weak
          enforcement, particularly in informal settlements and ecologically
          sensitive areas.
          <br /><br />
          Regionally, Colombo in the Western Province benefits from stronger
          institutions and more effective enforcement of urban, environmental,
          and labour laws, including the Urban Development Authority Act and
          Coast Conservation Act. In contrast, districts like Kurunegala,
          Anuradhapura, and Chilaw experience poor enforcement of land tenure,
          labour protections, and environmental regulations. In Chilaw,
          fisherfolk and estate workers often lack formal property rights,
          increasing vulnerability and exclusion from legal protections.
          <br /><br />
          The Plantation Region, faces inconsistent enforcement of the
          Plantation Labour Act. Estate workers remain largely landless, trapped
          in cycles of economic dependency without legal ownership or asset
          accumulation. Environmental laws under the National Environmental Act
          are also poorly applied, enabling land degradation.
          <br /><br />
          In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, land disputes critically hinder
          development. Tamil returnees in Kilinochchi and Mannar face contested
          claims from state agencies and settlers, while limited legal aid in
          Mullaitivu aggravates exclusion. Military occupation and religious
          land disputes, especially in Trincomalee, further weaken trust in the
          legal system and obstruct effective resettlement and environmental
          protections.
          <br /><br />
          Legal insecurity, weak land rights, and enforcement gaps significantly
          undermine social equity, sustainable livelihoods, and human
          development outcomes across Sri Lanka.

          >Gender Overview of Sri Lanka: National Context and Regional
          Disparities</b
        >

        <p class="caritas-text">
          <br /><br />
          Sri Lanka has made notable strides in gender equality, particularly in
          education. Female literacy rates are impressively high, ranging from
          90% to 96%, positioning the country among South Asia’s leaders in
          female educational attainment, according to Caritas Sri Lanka. This
          achievement reflects sustained government investments and societal
          valuing of girls’ education. However, despite these educational gains,
          gender disparities persist in economic participation and social
          empowerment, underscoring complex socio-cultural barriers that
          continue to limit women’s full inclusion in public and economic life.
          <br /><br />
          Labor force participation reveals one of the starkest gender gaps in
          Sri Lanka. While male participation exceeds 75%, female participation
          hovers around 35%, as reported by the Institute of Applied Statistics
          Sri Lanka (IASSL). This disparity is shaped by entrenched social
          norms, caregiving burdens, and constrained access to formal
          employment. Regionally, these differences are more pronounced.
          Districts such as Ampara report female labor force participation as
          low as 17.1%, reflecting traditional and rural settings where
          conservative gender roles prevail. Conversely, Nuwara Eliya shows a
          relatively higher rate of 45.8%, highlighting the influence of estate
          communities where women often engage in agricultural labor, albeit
          under informal conditions.
          <br /><br />
          Vulnerabilities linked to gender are also intensified by
          socio-political histories and household dynamics. Approximately 25% of
          Sri Lankan households are female-headed, many a consequence of
          war-related widowhood, especially in conflict-affected districts like
          Batticaloa in the Eastern Province. These female-headed households
          frequently face economic insecurity, lack adequate social protection,
          and experience marginalization in local governance and decision-making
          processes. Such challenges are exacerbated in rural and estate
          sectors, where institutional support remains weak and poverty levels
          are high, limiting women’s access to livelihoods and social services.
          <br /><br />
          Health and safety indicators present a mixed picture. Women generally
          enjoy higher life expectancy—76.9 years for females versus 71.3 years
          for males (IASSL)—yet face elevated risks of gender-based violence
          (GBV), including domestic abuse and sexual harassment. Older women in
          estate communities face compounded vulnerabilities due to economic
          marginalization and limited healthcare access. Additionally, the
          coexistence of multiple legal systems—civil, customary, and
          religious—creates complexities that often undermine women’s rights and
          protection, particularly in rural and minority communities, limiting
          their recourse against discrimination and abuse.
          <br /><br />
          In summary, while Sri Lanka exhibits strong educational gender
          achievements, economic, social, and legal disparities persist, with
          significant regional variations. Addressing these challenges requires
          targeted policy interventions focusing on enhancing women’s economic
          opportunities, strengthening social safety nets for vulnerable groups,
          combating gender-based violence, and harmonizing legal frameworks to
          ensure equitable protection and empowerment of all women across the
          nation.
