            Climate change is an inherent social issue that can upset anyone’s
            life in countless ways. Climate change is causing different social,
            economic, and public health issues on all the communities around the
            world. Therefore, advocating for climate justice by the local
            communities is the most essential solution to this worsening
            scenario. On that note, ‘Stepping Stone to Safeguarding Sri Lanka’s
            Natural Environment’ (SSEP) was implemented by Caritas Sri Lanka
            (CSL) with the funding support of Misereor in January 2022.The goal
            of the project is to advocate for solutions and to create awareness
            especially, among the grassroots level communities who are affected
            by the climate change environmental issues.
            <br /><br />
            As a first step of implementing SSEP in the entire island,
            environmental adult, youth and children groups were formed by the 13
            Dioceses of Caritas. 156 environmental groups were formed at the end
            of 2022 with the goal of creating environmentally conscious adults,
            youth and children under this project. SSEP is currently in its
            second phase, and several development activities &
            awareness-creation workshops are being undertaken by Caritas
            Diocesan Centers in Sri Lanka. On that note, an educational exposure
            tour to the Sinharaja rainforest was organized by Caritas
            Anuradhapura for 50 members of the environmental youth groups and
            another 10 members of the adult groups on the 5th & 6th of March
            2023.
            <br /><br />
            Sri Lanka is an island nation, which exhibits a wide array of
            ecosystems ranging from forest to agricultural, aquatic and marine
            environments. Despite its small size, Sri Lanka exhibits remarkable
            biological diversity and is considered to be the best bio diversity
            hotspot in the Asian region in terms of species concentration.
            Specific forest types including rainforests, dry zone monsoon
            forests and arid thorn scrub forests characterize the several
            climate zones that exist in the country. Hence, the Sinharaja
            rainforest is the country’s last viable area of primary tropical
            rainforest and a biodiversity hotspot, which is located in the
            Southwest lowland wet zone within Sabaragamuwa & Southern Provinces
            of Sri Lanka.
            <br /><br />
            The entire forest covers an area of 8,864 ha of primary and
            secondary forests, which lies between the tributaries of the Kalu
            Ganga in the North and the Gin Ganga in the South. Sinharaja forest
            was accepted by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve in 1978. The forest is
            made of 60% rare endemic trees and this forest is a home to many
            endemic wildlife such as birds, mammals, many kinds of insects,
            reptiles, rare amphibians and butterflies. Considering all the
            ecological importance of the forest, UNESCO declared Sinharaja
            forest as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1988 under the name of the
            Sinharaja forest reserve. Sinharaja rainforest is the habitat for
            rare and endangered species and an outstanding site for studying the
            process of biological evolution.
            <br /><br />
            This educational exposure visit was organized for the youth to make
            them aware of the best bio diversity hotspot available for Sri
            Lankans and to educate them of the different ecosystems that exist
            in the country. Rev.Fr. Bennette Mellawa the Director of Caritas
            Anuradhapura took responsibility for the entire exposure tour. Mr.
            Sujeewa Chamikara, a well-known environmentalist from MONLAR
            (Movement for Land and Agricultural Reforms) joined in to educate
            the participants.
            <br /><br />
            During the visit, he explained the importance of preserving the
            ecosystems which has a direct impact on the lives of every living
            being on earth. Mr. Chamikara took the lead role of guiding the
            participants inside the forest and explained what participants
            witnessed during their visit to the forest from organisms to the
            ecosystems. A glimpse of the rain forest and the ecosystem with its
            insects, reptiles, mammals etc, was introduced to the students with
            their scientific names.
            <br /><br />
            He also instructed the participants not to make noise while in the
            forest, as that would force the animals to move away from the
            walking paths. The participants were divided into 05 groups to build
            unity & responsibility among students during their 2-day exposure
            tour. Each team had to mention their objectives of the visit and
            share their ideas of the rainforest, ecosystems witnessed and
            learned.
            <br /><br />
            Day one (05/03/2023) was a fulfilling day for all the participants.
            The team entered the forest through the Pitadeniya entrance, which
            is located about 15 km away from Deniyaya town in Galle district.
            This entrance is also known as one of the most active entrances over
            the years because of Kekuna Ella waterfall, Pathan Oya waterfall and
            the hanging bridge in Pitadeniya Conservation Center. A journey of
            14 Km which includes both walking & hiking, the participants took
            nearly 08 hours to complete the journey. Students were able to see
            many rare species such as ferns, endemic plants like hora, and
            endemic vertebrates such as green pit viper, hump nosed lizard,
            kangaroo lizard, black grizzled giant squirrel, endemic fish
            varieties like Ceylonese Combtail, and many types of bird varieties.
            They also witnessed many endemic invertebrates such as giant
            earthworms, giant land snails, Sri Lankan giant millipedes, black
            caterpillar, endemic leeches during their exposure visit inside the
            forest on the day one.
            <br /><br />
            Mr. Chamikara helped the participants to identify variety of
            reptiles, mammals, and birds. He also explained about special
            adaptations that the wild animals gained over the years of evolution
            to catch their prey and to live in highly dense forests. With regard
            to the plants and trees, the environmentalist explained how trees
            help the forest to maintain the stability of the ecosystem and he
            also mentioned adaptations that some trees have gained to spread
            their seeds and stratification of trees in a tropical rainforest.
            Students were also able to experience natural fish therapy at Gal
            Oruwa waterfall, Thattu waterfall and Pathan oya waterfall inside
            the forest. It was a thrilling experience for many of them.
            <br /><br />
            Day two (06/03/2023) was an adventure visit. Students were taken to
            the Deniyaya, Kurulugala entrance of the forest which is located
            900m above the sea level via a safari ride nearly about 10 Km up in
            the hill. Kurulugala entrance is one of the ideal places in
            Sinharaja rainforest reserve for bird watching and butterfly
            watching. A journey of 10 Km, which includes both hiking and
            walking, took 5 hours to complete the exposure visit on day two.
            Students were able to see some varieties of butterflies such as tree
            nymph, small grass yellow butterfly, some varieties of birds such as
            blue magpie, spot winged thrust, white faced starling, woodpecker,
            caterpillars, rare varieties of monkeys, the smallest tree in the
            forest which is known as ‘Vana raja’, ferns, a rare variety of rock,
            and some mollusks.
            <br /><br />
            Mr. Chamikara also explained how his organization MONLAR campaigned
            against the road expansion inside Sinharaja forest area at
            ‘Gongala’. He further explained how such development work could
            cause negative impacts on the forest eco systems. He said, “We
            protested against the expansion mainly due to the fact that the
            particular reserved forest area has the highest number of endemic
            species; hence any development activity can disturb or destroy the
            normal life of the entire eco-systems of the forest”. Furthermore,
            he narrated why a forest like Sinharaja should be protected by all
            of us, stressing the importance of conserving the wildlife and its
            habitat. He said that we all have the responsibility to conserve the
            entire island and its nature.
            <br /><br />
            With this, the entire exposure visit came to an end. The
            participants thanked Fr. Benet, Mr. Chamika the environmentalist and
            the Caritas Anuradhapura team for organizing such an eye opening
            tour and said that they will never forget these 3 days in their
            lives.
