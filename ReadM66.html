            “Stepping Stone to Safeguarding Sri Lanka’s Natural Environment”
            (SSEP) is a project implemented by Caritas Sri Lanka in all its 13
            DCs from January 2022. It is a three-year project funded by Misereor
            with the goal of forming environmental sensitive empowered
            communities. The project will assist the selected communities who
            face the effects of environmental degradation, to address the
            environmental issues and to bring sustainable solutions while caring
            for our common home. Several development activities are currently
            undertaken by Caritas Diocesan Centers in their relevant Diocese
            under SSEP.
            <br /><br />
            For the protection of environment and natural resources, every DC
            was supposed to form 12 environmental groups in the selected area in
            their Diocese. Accordingly, an environmental adult group was formed
            in Keeri, a village located in Mannar District in February 2022
            under the SSEP. Though the number of members of the group was low at
            the beginning of the project, various community based activities
            such as beach clean-up, tree plantation campaigns, training sessions
            on organic home gardening & compost making, have attracted a
            sizeable group or people to be members by the end of 2022.
            <br /><br />
            Since Sri Lanka is currently going through the worst
            economic-crisis, most of the people lost their income in the
            country. Daily wages & the people who depend on monthly income are
            struggling to cope up with the food inflation since their income
            remains the same. Hence, the project team from National Center
            decided to help people who are severely facing the effects of the
            economic crisis situation of the country with a small grant project
            that can give some immediate income to the people. Caritas Mannar
            Valvuthayam in consultation with the communities and relevant
            stakeholders came-up with an idea of establishing a coconut oil
            production firm in Keeri village considering all the available
            resources, skills of the people, marketing opportunities in the
            village & sustainability of the project intervention. Once the
            project plan was introduced, the government officials highly
            appreciated the initiative and provided their common building as a
            production center to start the processing, production, marketing and
            storage facilities.
            <br /><br />
            In order to plan the activity to hit the target, Caritas Valvuthayam
            requested the group members to prepare their own business plan and
            submit. Based on the details of their business plan, an agreement
            was signed between Caritas Valvuthayam and production group as an
            evidence of project approval & commitment. Cash deposit was done on
            an installment basis to their relevant accounts. Machinery and other
            equipment were fixed with the guidance and support of government
            officials.
            <br /><br />
            Later an inauguration ceremony was organized by Caritas Valvuthayam
            under the leadership of the Director of Caritas Mannar Rev.Fr. Anton
            .This small firm was officially opened for people on 17th of January
            2023. Divisional Secretary of the area, GN, DO, SO, PHI, Samurthi
            officer, representatives of community members, people and
            environmental protection group members were also gathered for the
            gracious occasion. Government officials gathered for the event
            assured their continuous support and guidance for the successful
            operation of the firm.
            <br /><br />
            Within one week of the opening, 22 individuals from the village
            supplied 358 coconuts for a reasonable price to the firm. On the
            other hand, village people and police in the village, brought their
            processed coconuts for oil crushing. The firm is currently getting
            Rs.70 for crushing 1kg of dried coconut. This income is deposited
            into their account. To handle and manage the machinery a disabled
            active civilian from the village came forward and he is currently
            under training. This type of involvements of the local community in
            small intervention will ensure a sustainable income for the poor &
            vulnerable families in the village.
            <br /><br />
            Hence, this Coconut Oil Production Center is considered as a
            blessing of God and a gift of God to the community at this point of
            economic crisis. The ultimate goal of the entire teamwork is to
            increase their production capacity and employment opportunities in
            this village. From the total income, at the end of each month, 25%
            of the income will be deposited for the maintenance and electricity
            bill settlements. The rest will be equally divided among the members
            based on their working hours.
