            Caritas Chilaw and Colombo celebrated the World Children’s day 2022
            with the Environmental Children Groups that they have formed under
            ‘Stepping stone to safe guarding Sri Lanka’s Natural Environment’
            project, (SSEP).
            <br /><br />
            <b>Colombo</b>
            <br /><br />
            Caritas Colombo Seth Sarana celebrated the Children’s day 2022 at
            Muturajawela on 01st of October 2022. A group of 120 children from
            Moratuwa, Weliveriya and Bopitiya Environmental Children Group
            participated in this event. Rev.Fr. Lawrence Ramanayake, the
            Director of Seth Sarana gave opening remarks at the event. In his
            speech, he explained the importance of World Children’s day as well
            as the responsibility that lies with children in protecting the
            environment.
            <br /><br />
            Children were taken for an exposure tour to Muturajawela sanctuary
            on that day. Muturajawela is a coastal wetland eco system located in
            Gampaha District of Western Province Sri Lanka. Muturajawela marsh
            land named as ‘Protected area for bio diversity conservation’ by the
            wildlife Act 1989 and still it has not been declared as an
            international RAMSAR site. The Muturajawela marshes are 3068
            hectares in size and this is country’s largest saline coastal peat
            bog. This marsh is prominent for its unique and highly diverse
            eco-system and is listed as one of 12 priority wetlands in Sri
            Lanka. Muturajawela is one of the main bio diversity hot spot in Sri
            Lanka consisting wide array of endemic/ residence and common flora
            and fauna species. This wetland is also the home to the largest peat
            deposits in the island. This area is popular among local and foreign
            travellers as ‘Muturajawela bird watching site’. Upon recognizing
            the ecological significance of Muturajawela, the Government of Sri
            Lanka declared the northern section of the marsh covering an area of
            1777 hectares as a sanctuary in July 1996, under the Fauna and Flora
            Protection Ordinance, which is administered by the department of
            Wildlife Conservation.
            <br /><br />
            At present, the bio-diversity of Muturajawela is threatened by
            un-planned development activities, growing human population and
            pollution. Knowing the importance of Muturajawela, as a small step
            to conserve the wetland, Caritas Colombo Seth Sarana has formed
            Environmental adult, youth and children groups in Muturajawela under
            SSEP. The main purpose of these environmental groups is to advocate
            against the harmful human activities, which threaten the sustenance
            of the eco-system there.
            <br /><br />
            During the exposure tour a special awareness session for the
            children was conducted. The importance of the Muthurajawela
            environmental eco system and how the wetland is serving its purpose
            was the main objective of the session, explained by Mr. Dinusha
            Nanayakara, Secretary of Archbishop’s committee to Protect
            Muthurajawela Wetland. He also pointed out how the wetland is being
            destroyed by people who are much more drawn by financial gains.
            <br /><br />
            As mangroves are part of eco system at Muthurajawela, he also
            explained the ecological importance of mangrove trees and side
            effects of destroying them.
            <br /><br />
            Mr. Samantha Perera who is an agriculturist and the founder of You
            Tube channel ‘Ape Koratuwa’ conducted an awareness session on the
            importance of local food and the importance of organic farming to
            the children. He also explained how to prepare a healthy drink made
            from local rice.
            <br /><br />
            An art competition was also conducted for the children after the
            exposure tour to Muturajawela on what they had seen and observed.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Chilaw</b>
            <br /><br />
            Caritas Chilaw celebrated the Children’s day with Iranawila and
            Madawatta environmental children’s group. 80 children and 22 youths
            from environmental youth groups participated in this event. Children
            were taken for an exposure tour to Anawilundawa bird sanctuary.
            <br /><br />
            Anawilundawa bird Sanctuary is situated in Puttalam District in
            North Western Province of Sri Lanka. This Sanctuary is set out on
            1397 hectares of forest land and comprises of nine tanks. These
            tanks stores water for irrigation and cultivation which is also acts
            as a natural habitat for water birds in addition to a few species of
            threatened fish, amphibians, mammals and reptiles. The importance
            and the uniqueness of the bird sanctuary is its immediate proximity
            to three different eco-system which have vast distinctions and
            characteristic. It is one of the six RAMSAR wetland mainly due to
            its coast, the mangroves and the fresh water tanks. This unique
            ecological setting has made it a favourable nesting and breeding
            ground for hundred species of birds. The Anawilundawa Wetland is a
            bird watchers’ heaven. Both resident and migratory bird species can
            be seen throughout the year. The period from October to April is the
            best time for getting a glimpse of many rare migratory birds.
            <br /><br />
            An awareness session on the importance of protecting the environment
            and the responsibilities that a child has in protecting the
            environment was the theme taken by Mr. Edmond Samaranayaka, a
            psycho-social consultant who joined in as the resource person during
            their exposure tour. He also shared with them a few techniques on
            meditation with nature.
